HIF Global, an eFuel company engaged in the production of carbon-neutral fuels has announced plans for the development of Project Helix, a US$ 6bn renewable fuel plant on a 540-acre site in Matagorda County, Houston, a large metropolis in Texas. HIF made the announcement for the facility, which will be the first of its kind in the region to recycle carbon dioxide into transportation fuels, together with the Texas Governor Greg Abbott, the Matagorda County Economic Development Corporation, and other community partners as well. Project Helix, the implementation of which is set to commence in 2023 is expected to create approximately 3,000 direct jobs during its construction. Upon completion, the facility will create over  125 permanent positions, and produce 200 million gallons of renewable fuel per year, which will serve as a carbon-neutral gasoline substitute and decarbonize over 400,000 vehicles in the U.S. Also Read US$700 Louisiana Green Fuels project to produce renewable fuels According to the developers, the carbon-neutral gasoline substitute which will be produced from the Project Helix renewable fuel plant, can be used in vehicles without needing modification to existing engines, and this renewable fuel will be produced through the combination of CO2 from the atmosphere and hydrogen from 100% renewable wind power. Executive Director Meg Gentle explained that this technology wasn’t actually new and had been applied previously in smaller applications, but this was the first time it was being combined to make fuel. She said the green hydrogen would be created through a process called electrolysis and the hydrogen produced will be mixed with CO2 captured by a nearby industrial plant, thereby reducing the emissions into the atmosphere.
