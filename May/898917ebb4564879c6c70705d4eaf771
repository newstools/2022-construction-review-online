A contract for the implementation of a remote airbase expansion project in Jordan has been awarded by the United States Department of Defense, an executive branch department of the federal government, referred to as Pentagon and charged with coordinating and supervising all agencies and functions of the government directly related to national security and the United States Armed Forces. The construction works for the remote airbase expansion project stem from the increased American military presence in recent years in the country as they aim to bolster their security in the region.

The Pentagon revealed that the project cost will fund the construction of an air traffic control town that will be set in the eastern city of Azraq. While announcing the project contract, the department did not confirm the name of the base. However, they identified the headquarters of its 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing’s air combat command in Azraq as Muwaffaq Salti Air Base. The remote airbase expansion project in Jordan is the seventh awarded by the U.S Army Corps of Engineers. It is a part of a bigger expenditure worth $265 million which aims to drill water wells, repair runways as well as build dorms that can accommodate well up to 280 people. Ever since the 1950s, Jordan has had strong ties with the U.S. A senior researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Ghaith al-Omari stated that through this project, the country wants to take their relationship, to the “next level” by hosting American bases. He further added that it is seen as a guarantee of security in the case that if any of Jordan’s neighbours cause disruption, the U.S would intervene.
