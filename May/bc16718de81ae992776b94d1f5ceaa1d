Dubai Airport has confirmed the closure of the DXB northern runway in plans for the implementation of a rehabilitation project, scheduled between May 9th and June 22nd, a 45-day period. The DXB northern runway rehabilitation project will reportedly involve the placement of well over 30,000 m3 of concrete and 160,000 tonnes of asphalt to strengthen and resurface the adjacent taxiways as well as the runway. The project will also replace some 264 kilometres of secondary cables and approximately 4,400 runway lights will be upgraded to economic, environmentally friendly, and modern technology.

DWC will handle more than 1000 flights per week during the closure period with a huge majority of the flights being operated by Spice Jet, Gulf Air, flydubai, and Indigo. In addition to ensuring a smooth transition, DWC has set to re-open its guest experience and service touchpoints. Dubai Airports also ensured to give advance notice to all airlines to plan for flight reductions as well as schedule their planning accordingly. The CEO of Dubai Airports, Paul Griffiths, stated that the planning of the Dubai Airports northern runway rehabilitation project was carefully coordinated to minimize disruption to passengers, while still ensuring that the highest safety and guest experience standards at both airports were upheld.
