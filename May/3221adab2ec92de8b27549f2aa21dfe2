The project for the construction of the international standard eight-lane titan track in Ghana is phase three of the Association’s proposed four-phased Kwabotwe Center for Sports Excellence project, which is also under MOBA’s sponsorship. A basketball court worth GHC 1.2 million was the first phase, followed by a FIFA-standard football pitch worth GHC 1.6 million. According to Mr Eric Yankah, Chairman of the Sponsoring Year Group (SYG), the project is a well-formulated five-year development plan to facilitate sports events in the city. In addition, the association will provide the school with a 160,000-liter water supply system. Mr Yankah claimed that his organization could not do the international standard eight-lane titan track and overlook the school’s most pressing need. He added that the organization intends to double up as well as add 80,000 litres to the current 80,000 to ensure continuous water flow in the school.
