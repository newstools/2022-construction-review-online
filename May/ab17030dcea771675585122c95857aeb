The Centralidade do Halaval community and housing project was opened on Friday, May 13, in the presence of Angola’s President, Joo Lourenço, government Ministers, and a prominent delegation of Mitrelli Group and Kora, its subsidiary firm, led by Mitrelli’s president and founder, Haim Taib. The Centralidade do Halaval community and housing project was designed as part of the National Urbanism and Housing Program (PNUH) for the general welfare of Angola’s rising population. The government sought to give more than just a solution to its residents’ shelter requirements, realizing that national security and prosperity are inextricably related to caring for its people’s well-being. Kora, Mitrelli Group’s real estate and urbanism company that has established a unique strategy for developing urban communities, was chosen by the Angolan government to carry out this enormous undertaking.
