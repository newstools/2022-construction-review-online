Plans are underway for the development of a US$ 3.3M 52-bed Apex Rehabilitation Hospital in the western region of Wake County, North Carolina. Recently application for the project was recently submitted to the Town of Apex by LifePoint, a health organization consisting of several affiliated groups, who manage and own various hospitals around the U.S. Developed by a tri-venture made up of  Duke Health, a world-class academic and health care system that strives to transform medicine and health locally and globally, WakeMed Health, a private, not-for-profit health care organization based in Raleigh, and Kindred Healthcare, a post-acute healthcare services company that operates long-term acute-care hospitals and provides rehabilitation services across the United States, the hospital project is expected to break ground in the latter part of this year. Based on the preliminary drawings for the Apex rehabilitation hospital project, filed by Crunk Engineering of Brentwood, upon completion, the facility will be a 2-story building totalling 61,139 square feet, but the square footage of the first floor would be more than double the square footage of the second floor. Plans also call for 110 surface parking spaces and entry points into the rehabilitation hospital, situated next to the WakeMed Apex Healthplex at 5301 Apex Peakway, through Zeno Road and Olive Chapel Road. The hospital will also feature wings for orthopaedic, stroke and neurological conditions, along with private rooms and bathrooms. On the first floor, the main therapy suite will be provided along with private therapy rooms, a therapy gym, rooms for multiple therapy protocols, cooking therapy rooms and an “Activities of Daily Living” therapy suite.

According to WakeMed’s senior vice president of Strategic Ventures and Ambulatory Operations, the combination of already-licensed beds for the hospital would enable Duke and WakeMed to provide services in an area, that neither of them could manage alone.
