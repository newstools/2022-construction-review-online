The construction of Lafayette-West, a US$ 150M 318-unit condominium and apartment project developed by Mark Bennett, a Detroit developer as a link between Lafayette Park and the wider downtown region of Detroit, has begun. The development will feature a variety of studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom floor plans ranging in size from 436 square feet to 1,223 square feet, as well as secured and enclosed parking, gourmet kitchen appliances, a large modern fitness centre, swimming pool, electric vehicle charging stations for all vehicles, co-working, a club room and social room, and other amenities.

All affordable apartments are proportionate to the unit/floorplan mix of each building and are unconstrained in terms of location inside the building. The complex is located in Lafayette Park and is within walking distance of various regional attractions, central business district employment districts, arenas and entertainment venues, Eastern Market, the Dequindre Cut bicycle/walking route, the new Meijer Rivertown Market, and the River Walk. The development earned a Brownfield TIFF with a municipal part of $11.2 million over 30 years, as well as a 15-year NEZ with a city portion of $5.3 million. “We viewed this as a great chance to create a unique community that would add to the lives of the Lafayette Park residents. Lafayette-West has distinguishing features and is ideally accessible while being affordable to Detroit residents,” explained Bennett. “Lafayette-West will be a wonderful addition to the Lafayette Park area, providing homeowners with a lovely neighbourhood setting just outside of downtown,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan adding, “Because 20% of the apartment units will be allocated for persons earning less than the regional average, Detroiters of diverse income levels will be able to live together in this lovely new neighbourhood.”
