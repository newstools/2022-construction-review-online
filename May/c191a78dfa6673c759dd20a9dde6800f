Plans have been announced for the implementation of Streeterville mixed-use project on the northeast corner of E Grand Avenue and N St Clair in Chicago. A co-development and joint venture between Mavrek Development, a full-service developer and general contracting firm based in Chicago, GW Properties, a full-service real estate development and investment company based in Chicago that specializes in retail properties, and Luxury Living Chicago Realty,  a rental-focused real estate brokerage, made the announcement. The NORR-designed Streeterville mixed-use project will feature 248 Class A luxury apartments, 40,000 square feet of office space, and 8,000 square feet of street-level retail. To satisfy post-pandemic rental preferences, the property will have a variety of floorplans ranging from studios to two bedrooms, with a focus on in-unit workstations and private outdoor space.
