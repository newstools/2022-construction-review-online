A zoning application for residential development at 330 W Chestnut in Chicago has been submitted. The project site is located on the Near North Side, near the northeast corner of W. Chestnut St. and N. Orleans St. The construction, planned as a collaboration between Draper and Kramer and BlitzLake Partners, will replace an empty site close to the elevated CTA rails. FitzGerald Associates Architects designed the structure, which will rise nine floors above the street. It will be 125 feet tall and will house 129 premium apartments, as well as 13 vehicle parking spots and 80 bike parking places. The residential lobby will occupy the building’s corner at the junction of W. Chestnut St and N. Orleans St on the first level, and a small retail area will front N. Orleans St. The lobby will be flanked with amenity space and leasing offices, with parking in the back along the alley.

The facade will have metal and glass windows, metal panelling, brick, and stucco. Balconies will be built onto the building’s corner above the lobby and along the east facade, facing the CTA L rails towards the lake. The development will have a mix of convertible, one-bed, and two-bed apartments, as well as a full range of facilities. Coworking space, a fitness studio, a resident lounge, and a landscaped sky terrace will be available. The land for 330 W Chestnut Chicago will be rezoned from C1-5 to DX-5 and designated as a planned development, according to the developers. The project will need to be approved by the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the whole City Council. The proposal may potentially be heard by the Design Committee. A construction timeline has not been specified.
