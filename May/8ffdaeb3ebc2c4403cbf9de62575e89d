Cushman & Wakefield, a global commercial real estate services business, has revealed that more than $224 million in construction finance has been acquired for the construction of the Portman’s 1020 Spring Office Tower. The tower is a component of the three-pronged Portman Holdings’ project in Midtown Atlanta, or simply Midtown, which is a high-density commercial and residential neighbourhood of Atlanta, Georgia.

The 528,000-square-foot Portman’s 1020 Spring Office Tower, the construction of which is expected to break grounds this quarter, will be built adjacent to the nearly century-old Spring Hill Mortuary (H.M. Patterson House), a Philip Trammell Shutze-designed landmark that will be adapted and blended into the three-pronged Portman Holdings’ project dubbed Spring Quarter as a “new destination retail experience,”. Upon completion, the office building will have approximately 8,000 square feet of retail space at its base, an 11-storey parking garage (four levels beneath, seven above) with 936 parking spots, and a ratio of 1.8 spaces per 1,000 square feet of office space. The offices require ceiling heights of more than 13 feet and floor-to-ceiling windows to maximize skyline views. Other features of the Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates (KPF)-designed project include what might be Atlanta’s first new indoor pickleball court adjacent to the indoor-outdoor fitness centre, a lobby café, terraces and balconies on each story, and an open coworking area near a rooftop bar. In a statement, Brian Linnihan, vice-chair of Cushman & Wakefield, described the Portman’s 1020 Spring Office Tower as “the next crown gem of the city” and observed that Midtown office demand is “4.5 times larger than supply for full-floor vacancies available, spearheaded by the IT tenants fuelled by Georgia Tech.”
