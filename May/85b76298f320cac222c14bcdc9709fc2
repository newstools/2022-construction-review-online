Quayside 12,  a build-to-rent scheme set for development on Newcastle’s Quayside has, through its developer Packaged Living, received planning permission from the Newcastle City Council. A planning inspector approved the controversial plans for the 289-flat development on a Homes England-owned site, concluding that the scheme’s public benefits outweighed concerns about its design. The project will sit on a total of a 1.5-acre piece of land located along the river. The site is the last remaining plot of the Farrell Masterplan from the 1990s, and it has been vacant for over 30 years. Prior to the construction of the new development, the site will be completely remediated. The development will become the largest build-to-rent scheme in Newcastle when completed. It will feature 289 new homes, with studios, one, two, and three-bedroom apartments, as well as extensive amenity space, commercial space, and on-site parking. A resident’s lounge, co-working spaces, private dining rooms, and recreational facilities will be available to residents and locals. Work at the site is set to begin later this year.

Quayside 12 will aim for net-zero carbon construction and low embodied carbon in specified building targets. The development will also provide significant benefits to Newcastle, including the creation of over 700 construction jobs and an estimated £4 million in annual spending in the local economy. “We are happy to have reached this critical milestone in the delivery of the iconic development at the heart of Newcastle’s quayside,” said Mark Woodrow, Managing Director, Packaged Living. Newcastle will benefit from the scheme by receiving much-needed quality, purpose-built rental homes. We hope to begin construction on site by the fourth quarter of this year.”
