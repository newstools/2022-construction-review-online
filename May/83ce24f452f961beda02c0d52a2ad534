The Duqm Integrated Power & Water Project is being developed by the Duqm Power Company LLC which is a joint venture between Gulf Energy, one of the leading energy producers in Thailand, producing safe, reliable energy now and for the future, and Oman Oil Company S.A.O.C. (OOC), a commercial company wholly owned by the Government of the Sultanate of Oman. Following the completion of the project later this year, DIPWP will have an installed generating capacity of 326MW in combined-cycle duty and 36,000 cubic meters of desalinated water for Duqm refinery and petrochemical facilities per day. The facility is set to meet the requirements of a new DRPIC refinery and petrochemical complex, that is adjacent to the facility. The two further complement Oman’s economic diversification plans as well as point focus toward building up the country’s industrial sector.
