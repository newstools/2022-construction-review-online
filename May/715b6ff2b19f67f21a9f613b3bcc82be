Plans are in for the construction of the first High Purity Aluminum Facility in the United Arab Emirates following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the development of the project. The MoU was signed between DUBAL Holding, an investment company focused on commodities and mining, power, water and energy, and industrial projects, and Nature Alu, a Canadian high-purity aluminium producer and the only high-purity producer in the Americas. As a part of their partnership, Nature Alu and DUBAL Holding will carry out a feasibility study that will support the project’s evaluation alongside the decision-making process. DUBAL Holding will liaise with government officials, local stakeholders as well as local counterparties to gain access to important regional and local data that will then be used for a feasibility study. The data in the study will include insightful information regarding operational expenses in regards to energy, asset maintenance, manpower, and many more other criteria.
