Contractors are being pursued to undertake the Immingham Eastern Roll-on Roll-off Ferry Terminal project in the North East Lincolnshire unitary authority of England, under a £100 million contract. The contract calls for the construction of three new outer harbour berths for freight ferries at the end of an approach jetty, as well as designing and constructing a new passenger terminal building that will include an engineering workshop and all incidental works. It is conditional on Associated British Ports receiving a development consent order, which is expected to be submitted this summer. Construction is scheduled to begin in mid-2023 and be completed in spring 2025. Stena Line, a Swedish ferry company, has already agreed to run the new terminal for the next 50 years. Associated British Ports announced the suppliers in its new group professional services contract framework in February, including WSP, Aecom, Mott MacDonald, and many others. The agreement is for four years with the possibility of extending for another two, and the contractors will work on a wide variety of tasks across ABP’s 21 ports and group locations across the country.
