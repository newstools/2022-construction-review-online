Due to Korea’s technological prowess and the success of Korean companies in various cooperative initiatives such as the K-9 Self-propelled Howitzer project, the Cairo Metro project, and involvement in the Nag Hammadi-Luxor railway modernization project, it is expected that Korea will significantly play a part in Egypt’s overall railway infrastructure capabilities and safety through financial backing. Additionally, Korea’s active engagement in Egypt’s transportation infrastructure will be a sign of future-oriented economic cooperation between the two countries, helping to improve the quality of life for Egyptians.
