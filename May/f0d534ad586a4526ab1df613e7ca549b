The Delta State government recently announced that it is spending N5.1 billion to construct an international conference centre in Asaba, the capital of the state. The state capital’s development into a megacity, according to Delta Commissioner for Information Charles Aniagwu, demands the construction of the International Conference Centre in Asaba. The state government, according to Aniagwu, plans to execute the construction of the international convention centre in Asaba within 12 months and has allocated a 35 per cent mobilization fee for the contractor to ensure timely completion. Aniagwu claimed that the events centre they have does not fulfil the purpose of an international conference centre where different break-out rooms and committee meetings are normally held, thereby requiring something of a world-class level, comparable to the one in Abuja. He claimed that Exco also approved the construction of a cottage hospital at Ovwor-Olomu at a total cost of N423 million. Exco, according to Aniagwu, also approved the construction of 2.49km of internal roads in Kokori and 2km of Eku internal roads in Ethiope East Local Government Area; 1.17km of Obi Palace Road Ubulu-Uno, Aniocha South; 2km of Anioge Street Idumesah, Ika North East; 1.8km of internal roads in Burutu; and 1.2km of rigid pavement on Dr Mike Loyibo Street in Tuomo, Bomadi Local Government Area.

The repudiation of the Mini sports arena in Koko, Warri North, and the approval of N543 million in compensation for verified property owners at the defunct Abraka market in Asaba was among several decisions made at the Exco meeting. Due to rising costs of materials, Aniagwu claimed that the ten projects were submitted to Exco for assessment.
