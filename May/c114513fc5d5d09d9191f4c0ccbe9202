The new administrative building and campus that are currently under construction for Marondera University of Agricultural Science and Technology (MUAST) in Zimbabwe, on Cloverhill farm, near Grasslands High School, about 7 kilometres from Marondera town, are reportedly taking form. MUAST vice-chancellor Professor Justice Nyamangara during a recent media tour of the site in Marondera said that the building project is moving well despite the setbacks caused by funding issues. The university is now headquartered in the Cold Storage Commission headquarters in Marondera’s industrial sector. The main campus’s foundation has already been built, and workers will shortly begin installing the pillars that will support the entire edifice. On the agricultural front, MUAST, Zimbabwe’s only fully-fledged agricultural institution, is placing 140 acres of land under wheat that will be irrigated using water from the recently completed Muchekeranwa Dam. Six centre pivots have already been erected for this purpose.

The MUAST Agro-Industrial Park’s principal mission is to lead agricultural practices that encompass the whole value chain of livestock and crops in adopting the Education 5.0 model. The park will be utilised as a teaching laboratory for students, where they will be exposed to highly mechanised and precision farming, ensuring that they will be highly proficient in agricultural and livestock production upon graduation.
