Summer is around the corner, meaning it’s time to start thinking about how you will spend your time outdoors. A great way to enjoy the warmer months is by creating a beautiful outdoor space where you can relax. This post will give you five tips to help you get started. When creating an inviting outdoor space, you want to ensure the space is well lit to feel safe and welcoming. Consider adding solar lights or string lights to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. LED deck lights are a great way to add ambient lighting to your outdoor space. They can be used to highlight features, create a soft glow, or provide task lighting. When the temperatures start to rise, spending time outdoors becomes a top priority. However, heat can sometimes feel more like an oven than an oasis. One way to combat the heat is to create a shady spot in your outdoor space. Here are a few tips to help you create an inviting retreat: If you have a deck or patio, install a retractable awning. This will allow you to enjoy the sun or shade as desired. Trees and shrubs can provide natural shade and also help to cool the air around them through evapotranspiration. Deciduous trees are especially effective as they provide shade in the summer and allow sunlight through winter. If you don’t have room for trees or shrubs, consider creating a trellis or pergola and planting grape vines or other climbing plants. The vines will provide shade in the summer and can provide privacy year-round. One most critical aspect of creating an inviting outdoor space is ensuring comfortable seating. Choose furniture that is the right size for the space. You want enough room to move around, but you don’t want the furniture to feel cramped. Think about how you will use the space and choose furniture accordingly. If you entertain often, you may want to invest in a larger dining table and chairs. If you’re looking for a place to relax, a comfortable sofa or loveseat may be better. The furniture you select should be durable and withstand the elements. Outdoor furniture is exposed to the elements year-round, so it needs to withstand sun, rain, snow, and everything in between. One way to make your outdoor space more inviting is to add some color. This can be done through flowers, furniture, or even painting your fence. Adding color will make the space feel alive and vibrant, and it will be more enjoyable to spend time in. One way to make your outdoor space feel like home is by adding personal touches. This ranges from family photos to a favorite piece of art. Adding personal touches will make the space feel more like your own and less like another room in your house. Outdoor spaces can be a great way to connect with nature and improve your well-being. By following these tips, you can create an inviting outdoor space perfect for relaxing or entertaining guests.
