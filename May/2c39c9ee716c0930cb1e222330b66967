Funding for site improvements of the Caldwell Industrial Park project will be covered by the JobsOhio-Ohio Southeast Site Initiative, a program that began in 2018 with the aim of assisting southeastern Ohio counties, through the development of competitive sites capable of winning new business investments. According to Brandon Crock, the co-owner and operator of Caldwell Lumber Do It Best and Crock Construction, the Caldwell  Industrial park which is intended to attract and bring in various logistics, light manufacturing, and oil and gas support industries to Noble County, Ohio, development was only possible through the investment and partnerships formed with the Noble County Commissioners, JobsOhio, the Ohio State University Extension, Olive Township Trustees and the Village of Caldwell. Crock said that this public-private partnership was the embodiment of a team that has worked together on a common goal for three years, to bring economic growth to Noble County. Mike Jacoby, the OhioSE President on the other hand said it was a pleasure to partner with a capable JobsOhio, the Ohio Department of Development, community leaders and a capable local developer like Crock Construction to make the new industrial park into a reality. He said that the hilly topography and limited reach of utilities in the region are barriers, which are difficult to surmount without effective teamwork.
