A new and the second clearwater lagoon beach that is being developed at Munyaka (Waterfall) estate by Balwin is expected to be finished in the fiscal year 2023. Balwin is a residential property developer that creates large-scale estates mainly comprising 1,000 to 2,000 sectional title residential flats in Johannesburg, Tshwane, the Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal, for people with low-to-middle incomes. The Blyde (Tshwane) was South Africa’s first development to have a unique clearwater lagoon created in a beach setting. Crystal Lagoons has granted the developer exclusive rights to build these freshwater lagoons at critical nodes in the future. As part of the Thaba Eco Village expansion in Rietvlei, a third lagoon is planned for Joburg South. Set to be completed in 2028 Munyaka waterfall estate is a close to US$ 568M gated complex located in the Waterfall area of Midrand, halfway between Johannesburg and Pretoria. It comprises 5,178 apartments ranging from one-, two-, and three-bedrooms to opulent three- and five-bedroom lagoon-facing penthouses.
