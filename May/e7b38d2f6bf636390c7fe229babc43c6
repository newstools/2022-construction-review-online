Cape Town Station, located on the intersections of Strand, Adderley, and Old Marine Drive in the Cape Town Central Business District (CBD), is set to be redeveloped into a 20-storey mixed-use facility featuring a 3,085-bed purpose-built student housing complex, 6,700 square metres of retail space, and a new world-class public plaza. The project is developed by Eris Property Group, a fully integrated commercial property development and services group operating in the South African and sub-Saharan African markets, as part of its “Eris’s RISE Student Living” brand. It will be implemented by GVK-Siya Zama, one of the largest privately-owned construction companies in South Africa, through an R1.1 billion contract. According to Eben Meyburgh, Group CEO of GVK-Siya Zama, the Cape Town station redevelopment project which is already in the works, is a complicated landmark project because of its location. It will require 31,281 cubic meters of concrete, 3,300 tons of rebar, 120,000 square meters of formwork, eight million bricks, and four tower cranes to carry materials vertically, and it will take around two years to complete, which means it will be ready for the 2024 student intake.

GVK-Siya Zama stated that it aims to pursue further projects of similar nature and has many in the works.
