The Governor went on to say that the road will make it easier to commute between the main campus of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) in Ogbomoso and the faculty established by his administration in Iseyin, and that the project is proof of his administration’s reliance on data and logic to build infrastructure that is targeted at the economy. In memory of the late former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala‘s contributions to the growth and development of Oyo State, he stated that the project would be named after him once it is completed.
