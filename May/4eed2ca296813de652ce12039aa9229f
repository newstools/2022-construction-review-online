Kwastina Brick Plant in South Africa, which according to the owner, Corobrik, is Africa’s most technologically sophisticated and environmentally friendly brick making plant was recently opened in a ceremony graced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the fifth democratically elected president of South Africa. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Ramaphosa said that the Kwastina brick plant, located in Driefontein, Gauteng, was one of the largest in the world and the largest in Africa and South Africa. The high-tech factory is totally automated, from raw material mixing to final output and it can create 100 million bricks per year, allowing it to handle higher-volume requests. Corobrik intends to meet at least 26% of the factory’s energy demands with renewable energy, and it also intends to minimise gas emissions from the kilns by at least two-thirds.

According to the President, the facility would also play an important role in the country’s economy, with the building being a fundamental aspect of the economy and critical to attempts to recover from the pandemic’s effects. Furthermore, he stated that the Kwastina Brick Plant was an excellent example of government and corporate collaboration, with the Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition engaging in some procedures. The facility’s construction helped to increase temporary employment and skill development, particularly with individuals from the surrounding region being taught.
