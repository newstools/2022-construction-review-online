A market engagement briefing is expected to be held soon before the announcement of the tender for the implementation of the third phase of the Midland Mainline Electrification programme in England. This came to light following an announcement that Network Rail Limited, the owner and infrastructure manager of most of the railway networks in Great Britain was seeking firms to participate in the exercise. Network Rail will hold the Midland Main Line electrification market engagement briefing event on the 15th of June 2022 at Pride Park Stadium in Derby, and online as an MS Teams live event. Rail infrastructure officials intend to present the most recent thinking for the project and solicit suggestions for the most efficient delivery method in order to avoid the cost overruns that have plagued previous electrification projects during this exercise. This phase, the cost of which is approximately £1 billion covers a 139km stretch of track from South Wigston to Sheffield, and it will be a continuation of the completed London to Corby electrification.
