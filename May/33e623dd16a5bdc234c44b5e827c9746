It will offer one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom apartment units, attracting both individuals and families, with income restrictions ranging from 30% to 80% of the Area Median Income. Located in one of Minneapolis’ Green Zones, Peregrine housing is pursuing LEED green building certification through the US Green Building Council in order to give its inhabitants a sustainable and energy-efficient living environment. UrbanWorks Architecture, an award-winning architecture firm in Minneapolis specializing in office, mixed-use, multifamily, and other complex urban infill projects designed the Peregrine housing in Minnesota, which will be built by Greiner Construction, a Minneapolis commercial contractor that provides strength from the inside-out—renovations, tenant improvements & new construction, and managed by Steven Scott Management, one of the largest locally owned property management firms in Minnesota. Colliers International, a Canada-based diversified professional services and investment management company, Hennepin County, the City of Minneapolis, Metropolitan Council, Bridgewater Bank, AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, and Huntington Bank supplied funding for the project.
