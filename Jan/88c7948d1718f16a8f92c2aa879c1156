Furthermore, due to the limited availability of grid infrastructure, La Definition features some unique solutions including a water recycling system that will utilize UFRO technologies to reduce demand for borehole water by up to 80% through the use of rain and greywater. An energy center based on the gasification of sustainable waste streams i.e. dewatered sewage sludge, ground tires, etc., will be developed at the site to produce clean syngas and generate electricity and heat for the development with zero CO2 emissions. In addition, ~750kWp of PV, and BIPV as shading for facades, will also be integrated. Upon completion, the development is expected to be the first one in the West African region to be certified under the new EDGE sustainability rating introduced by the IFC/World Bank.
