With a total capacity of 1000 MWp, the power plants will be constructed in batches of 50 to 300 MWp on a total area of 4,250 hectares piece of land distributed over 11 sites on the Algerian national territory. Some of the project sites will be located in El Bayadh, Ouargla, El Oued, El M’Ghair, Ghardaia, and Bechar. In addition to the construction of the power plants, the SPVs will also be responsible for the installation of evacuation facilities and the connection of the power plants to the North African country’s national electricity grid. Electricity generated by the “Solar 1000MW” Project in Algeria is set to be sold to a “designated buyer” under a 25 years power purchase agreement (PPA). The Algerian Renewable Energy Company (SHAEMS, Spa) is expected to evaluate various technical and financial offers after the submission of the tenders before formulating the power purchase tariffs. The implementation of the “Solar 1000MW” Project in Algeria comes from the North African country government’s desire to move bit by bit away from natural gas, from which nearly 98% of its electricity is produced. As part of its strategy, the country, therefore, plans to produce 22 GW of green energy by 2030, with 13.6 GW reserved for solar photovoltaic.
