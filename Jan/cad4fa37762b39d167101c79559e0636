A groundbreaking event for the Renaissance Center took place recently at the site of a vacant lot, located on the 7th and San Pedro Street, in Skid Row, Los Angeles. The inauguration ceremony was hosted by the project’s developer, Healthy Housing Foundation and its founder, The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), to mark the start of a new low income housing project. Healthy Housing Foundation was created in 2017 for the sole purpose of providing affordable housing and this project would be it’s 13th affordable housing development in  Los Angeles. According to the hosts of the Renaissance Center’s groundbreaking ceremony, the statistics on homeless people in Southern California is not an adequate representation of the colored people. For this reason, the event was made to coincide with the weekend of Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, in honor of his vision for human rights of the underprivileged, poor and homeless people, especially those of color.
