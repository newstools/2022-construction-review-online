The Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, recently flagged off the construction of the Ojota-Opebi link bridge and approach roads. The project, conceived 20 years ago by the government of Senator Bola Tinubu, will be carried out by Messrs Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, a leading Nigerian company offering holistic services covering the planning, design, engineering, construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings, infrastructure, and industrial projects in Nigeria. Julius Berger was awarded the contract after carrying out extensive studies and engineering investigations along the project alignment. The project, which is expected to be completed in 20 months, entails the construction of a bridge with a total length of 3.89km, including 2829m of road, 276m of a deck-on-pile bridge, and 474m of mechanically stabilized earth wall approach sections.

The approach roads will reportedly enhance vehicular movement towards Opebi/Allen/ Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way via Sheraton Link Bridge/Kudirat Abiola Way and its environs, and significantly reduce the incessant traffic gridlocks experienced in the area over the years. According to Sanwo-Olu, the Ojota-Opebi Link Bridge and access roads project is another milestone in the implementation of the Traffic Management and Transportation Pillar of his administration’s THEMES Agenda and the State Strategic Transport Master Plan (STMP). He said that his administration is committed to the welfare and well-being of Lagos state residents, and to the Greater Lagos Vision, adding that the project would enhance the livelihood of people in the host state.
