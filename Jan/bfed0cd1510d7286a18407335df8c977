Tullow Oil plc, a well-established, recognized oil and gas explorer and producer headquartered in London, UK, has submitted the final development plan (FDP) for the Lokichar Oil Project in Kenya The FDP was deposited with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (MoEP), which generates policies that are designed to create an enabling environment for efficient operation and growth of the energy sector in the East African country. The MoEP is therefore expected to undertake a review of the plan from whose result will set the path for a potential final investment decision on the local oil exploits. The submission of the final development plan comes on the backdrop of the raised stakes for the Lokichar Oil Project following a redesign of the development in the first half of 202.

The volumes of oil deposits also increased by 152 million barrels from 433 million barrels to a gross of 585 million barrels. The raised stakes for the project cleared up doubts over the viability of the Lokichar Oil Project, which has remained in the exploration stage since the discovery of oil in the Lokichar basin back in the early 2010s. The multinational oil and gas exploration company estimates that it will spend roughly US$ 3.4bn to deliver the first commercial oil. This cost entails digging additional wells and the development of a pipeline connecting the Turkana oil fields and the port of Lamu. According to the company, which in October 2021 announced that it was stepping up its search for a strategic partner to help it implement its development plan, it would cost approximately US$ 22 to produce a barrel of oil.
