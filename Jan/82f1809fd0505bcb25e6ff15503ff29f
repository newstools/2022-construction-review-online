Despite the fact that the number of buildings is not indicated in the current file, the development would include more than 7 million square feet. The structure would also benefit from the future Yonge North Subway expansion. Although little information about the project has been provided, it has been revealed that it would comprise over 29,000 square meters of non-residential space and over 635,000 square meters of residential space.
