The water will then be supplied through the existing industrial water pipes to OCP’s facilities in the Khouribga mining area, which has only one wastewater treatment plant that supplies the “Merah Lahrach” washing plant since 2012. At the OCP’s facilities in the Khouribga mining area, the water will be used to clean the phosphates after extraction. The wastewater treatment plant project in Kasbat Tadla, which is a part of the “Act4community Khouribga” action launched by the OCP, will contribute to the company’s objective to participate in the cleaning of Oum Er Rbia River, and preserve conventional water resources as well as boost socio-economic, cultural, and environmental development in the project region.
