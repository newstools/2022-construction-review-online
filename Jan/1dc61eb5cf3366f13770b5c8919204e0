From the second floor is 4 floors of vibrant co-working spaces, and additional 2 floors of premium office space on the top 2 floors that have sweeping 360-degree panoramic views of Joburg.  The rest of the building contains a 131 key business hotel with a completely unique aesthetic, and the public areas around the building on the ground floor level will be activated through the design of pedestrian-friendly landscaping and furniture. Noteworthy, the structure of the existing 4 storey building, previously a bank, is being retained and added onto new development. The Bank features an onsite gas generator and solar power plant, high ceilings with gorgeous exposed coffer slabs, full backup power, and water, high-performance glass façade, direct lift access to most office suites, dual fiber networks, and valet parking.  The building will mainly (90% of the time) be powered by renewable energy sources, such as the solar power facility on the roof to power the building, as well as a heat recovery system that reuses the waste heat from the HVAC to heat water for the hotel.
