The 48 tenants who lived at the site where the Pangani Affordable Housing Project is being developed recently selected new housing units at the project in an exercise spearheaded by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services. The tenants, each of which received KSh600, 000 to facilitate their resettlement rent for two years as construction of the Pangani affordable houses continued, and promised to be given the first priority when this project is completed, will be a part of the first group of occupants that will take ownership of the new units.
