The North wing for example has wide planted balconies that shade the façade, reducing heat loads and the need to cool the building as a result. The balconies also provide ideal office break-away spaces with fantastic views over the lush green forest of Dunkeld.  A façade of fins on the South wing on the hand shields the building from the harsh West sun while offering views to the East up Jellicoe Ave. The common walkways, lobbies, and meeting rooms on each floor overlook the heart of the building, (the courtyard0 which also serves as a meeting and collaboration space designed to enhance the flow and exchange of ideas.
