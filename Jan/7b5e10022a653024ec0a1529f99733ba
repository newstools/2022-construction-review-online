Construction has begun on the Bryn House mixed-use rental community in North Druid Hills, Georgia shortly after Allen Morris Company, the real estate developer in charge of the project, received a US$64 million construction loan from PNC and Truist. The five-story, 337-unit residential structure will have 574,479 buildable square feet, including a 175-square-foot parking deck and 2,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, which will comprise a coffee shop and wine bar connected to a pocket park with shaded outdoor sitting and games. Juneau Construction Company, which recently finished The Allen Morris Company’s Star Metals Residences, will serve as the general contractor and manage all construction once again.

Allen Morris Company’s 86th development will be North Druid Hills. It is also actively working on many projects in Atlanta. “We are delighted to collaborate with Truist and PNC on the funding of this exceptional project.” The North Druid Hills corridor is set to become a world-class medical and bioresearch powerhouse with the growth of the Emory and CHOA medical campuses. As a result, we feel there is a clear demand for high-quality rental housing in the neighbourhood that is currently unmet,” stated Spencer Morris, Chief Investment Officer of the Allen Morris Company, in a press statement.
