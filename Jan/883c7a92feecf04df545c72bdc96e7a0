A newly developed solar-powered desalination system in Kibaha, one of the six districts of the Pwani Region, Tanzania, has been commissioned by Boreal Light GmbH, a Berlin-based company specialized in renewable energy solutions for water treatment facilities. The system is installed particularly at the Medewell Health Center by the Kenyan-based company, WaterKiosk Africa, with the financial support of Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG), a subsidiary of the German Development Agency (KfW). The latter intervened within the framework of the development program initiated by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The solar-powered desalination system in Kibaha, with a capacity of over 100m3 per day that makes it the largest of its kind in Tanzania to date, is expected to primarily provide water for patient care, especially in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, which is experiencing new twists and turns, including the Omicron variant.

As part of its program to supply hospitals in the East Africa region with water from solar-powered desalination systems, the Berlin-based company with its Kenyan partner plan to develop more projects similar to the solar-powered desalination system in Kibaha, in Tanzania and its neighboring country Kenya. A total of more than five water desalination systems will be installed in Tanzania while Kenya will benefit from 23 such facilities. This project according to Hamed Beheshti, Boreal Light’s CEO, will offset more than 18,000 tons of CO2 per year, which is an excellent model of climate change mitigation practices in the continent.
