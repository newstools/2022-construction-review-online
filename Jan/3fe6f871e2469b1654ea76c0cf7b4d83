The capital city of Kenya, Nairobi, is set to be home to approximately 15,000 affordable houses as a result of the ongoing Mukuru Affordable Housing Project that is being implemented by the national government on a 55-acre piece of land that was reportedly recovered from grabbers along Enterprise Road in Industrial Area. The approximately Sh5 billion property belonging to the Kenya Meteorological Department, which is a non-profit making professional/scientific society that provides timely early warning weather and climate information for the safety of life, protection of property, and conservation of the natural environment, was recovered by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) that replaced the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission in the fight against corruption in government and the public sector, in 2020. Justice Elijah Obaga, the Environment, and Lands Court Judge ordered the revocation of title deeds issued to five companies claiming ownership of the property and ordered the firms to be barred from trespassing into the property.
