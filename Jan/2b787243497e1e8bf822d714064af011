Construction has broken ground on the ‘City North’ mixed use development in Phoenix, Arizona. The project will contain 3,000 residential units, 620 hotel rooms, 1.8 million square feet of corporate office space, and up to 100,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space when completed. The first phase of City North’s multifamily housing development will have 272 homes spread over 12 floorplans with one, two, and three bedroom options. Greystar, a real estate developer, will build, own, and operate the City North multifamily property. The first phase is scheduled to open in the summer of 2023, with leasing starting the winter before.

Crown Realty purchased the 100-acre land in north Phoenix for the City North development two years ago. The City North project’s initial vertical portion is located close to Desert Ridge Marketplace, at 56th Street and Loop 101. “It’s fantastic to see the progress and bustle taking place in City North. This is an excellent site for the employees to live in a really walkable environment, right in the heart of the Loop 101. “City North is a site where thought-leading enterprises will find it simple to grow and recruit the people they seek,” said Christine Mackay, Phoenix’s director of community and economic development. “Adding employment, for us, continues to make it so that folks in that region don’t have to go to downtown, they don’t have to go up along farther on the 101 South and other locations.”
