The next phase will consist of techno-economic studies for the building, a design of the electrical infrastructures, and the establishment of partnerships with suppliers. According to Total Eren, the project will enter its active phase by 2025, and the first production is expected in 2027. The project is expected to allow the country to decarbonize certain major sectors of its economy, including mining and maritime transport. It also represents an opportunity to create a Moroccan industrial sector of green energy that will generate thousands of jobs, direct or indirect, non-relocatable and competitive. It will also enable the North African country to supply clean energies to Europe and contribute to its plans to become a global leader in the green hydrogen ecosystem.
