The planned transfer of over 2 000 Lubimbi people in the Binga district to make room for the Gwayi Shangani Dam has put the villagers in limbo, with reports that the government had not funded the move. Nakanono has been designated as the preferred relocation option by the affected communities. Between the Shangani River and the Victoria Falls-Bulawayo Highway is the land.

According to some villagers, the government has dispatched evaluation teams to where they plan to relocate. By November of last year, this judgement had been made. The community was then instructed to choose a preferred relocation site, which they did. They are now waiting for official confirmation. The relocation process has been accelerated. There has been no mention of a specific day or period. During the agricultural season, villagers were warned not to till their property. Villagers are dissatisfied that the national budget for 2022 does not contain compensation for those who would be evicted from their ancestral lands. Some stated that they had hoped that the national budget would allocate funding for compensation to the communities who would be relocated, but that this had not happened. They said that they anticipate the government confirming the site where roads and other infrastructure buildings, such as schools, dip tanks, and clinics, would begin in earnest. Villagers were first advised to leave the area by the end of last month, according to Lubimbi councillor Chrispen Mnkuli. Mnkuli stated that they had contacted the government on the problem and had chosen a preferable relocation site, but the government’s attitude was unclear. Land Kabome was recently selected as Binga’s district development coordinator. The government recently assessed the value of properties likely to be damaged by the development of the Gwayi-Shangani Dam in Lubimbi to compensate the victims. The construction of the Gwayi-Shangani Dam has been marred by controversy since individuals who would be relocated were not consulted on the matter. China Sunlight Africa will provide the Zimbabwean government with US$52m to be used in the construction of Gwayi-Shangani Dam in Matabeleland. According to Charles Mugari, the Deputy General Manager of China Africa Sunlight Energy, US$104 will be used for constructing a power grid to be connected to the national grid, and US$1bn will be for constructing a power plant. The company has also been awarded an Environmental Impact Assessment Certificate (EIA) by the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) to construct the power station at Gwayi. The Minister for Energy and Power Development in Zimbabwe noted that construction of power station will help curb power deficits in the country. At the moment, the power output from traditional power plants is 1,500MW, yet the end users need upto 2,000MW daily. Zimbabwe is capable of producing this amount given that it has thermal, hydro, solar and methane gas resources. At the moment, there are five hydro projects under way: Gaerezi, Ruti, Nyamhingura, Chipendeke and Pungwe, and are all expected to be completed by 2015. Constructon of the Gwayi-Shangani dam will help provide water to the 300MW power station under the construction by China Sunlight Africa at the coal-mining Gwayi. The power plant is expected to be completed by 2016. The Chinese contractor in charge with construction of the Gwayi Shangani Dam in Matabeleland North Province resumed work on earlier on this week after Treasury availed $5m towards the project. This is following the suspension of work by the contractor in four years back due to lack of funding. Zinwa public relations manager Mrs. Marjory Munyonga said the China Water and Electric Corporation was back on site and already crushing stones for concrete works.Mrs. Munyonga said more resources will be availed as the project picks. Gwayi-Shangani, which will be Zimbabwe’s third largest water reservoir after Tokwe-Mukosi and Lake Mutirikwi, is a major component of the National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project, considered as the long term solution to Bulawayo’s water challenges.

Upon completion, the dam, which is on the confluence of Gwayi and Shangani rivers, is projected to bring about a lot of socio-economic transformation for surrounding communities and other parts of the drought prone Matabeleland North Province. The dam will also have the capacity to generate six mega-watts of electricity. The resumption of work at the dam and its subsequent completion are among the key benchmarks Government set for the Infrastructure and Utilities Cluster under the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation. Approximately $90m is required to complete the Gwayi-Shangani Dam project, which is also expected to promote agricultural enterprises. President Mugabe recently commissioned Zimbabwe’s largest inland water body, Tokwe-Mukosi Dam in Chivi south, which is already 70% full, has a capacity of 1,8 Bn cubic metres. Tokwe-Mukosi, located in the drought-prone southern Masvingo, was financed by Government at a cost of $260m. The Gwayi-Shangani Dam, one of the national projects under Zim-Asset will reach completion in the next two years. The Managing director of China International Water and Electric Corporation Mr. E Shangfa said they expect to start construction of the dam wall early next year. He also pointed out financial challenges as the reason for the delay as they started work 4 years after setting up. He further added that most of the work will be done next year. Mr Shangfa promised to give monthly progress reports on the project. He said their major setback was the unavailability of foreign currency to import parts for equipment. This year alone, Mr Shangfa said, they required between US $8m and US $12m to import equipment. Additionally, the same amount was to pay the project designer, Yellow River Consultancy of China.

He also said that as a national project, the President is closely following the development. VP Mphoko also took note of the challenges the company was facing and promised to look at them in order to ensure the work is complete in time. The Gwayi-Shangani Dam will be the largest water body in Matabeleland North province with a holding capacity of 635 million cubic metres of water. On completion, the dam will bring about socio-economic transformation for surrounding communities. The dam, which is on the confluence of Gwayi and Shangani rivers, will also have the capacity to generate six megawatts of electricity. The government of Zimbabwe has launched the construction of a pipeline expected to draw raw water from the Gwayi-Shangani dam to the city of Bulawayo. The project which was launched by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa aims to pump raw water from the Gwayi-Shangani dam to supply Bulawayo and surrounding communities in the arid Matabeleland region. The development is also part of the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project (MZWP) whose overall objective is to end the permanent water shortage in this arid province. The project is being implemented in several phases. In the first phase, the authorities want to deliver the Gwayi-Shangani dam. The dam is being built on the Zambezi River in the Hwange and has been entrusted to China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), a subsidiary of the giant China Three Gorges Corporation (CTE). The Chinese company was supposed to commission the reservoir in 2021. However, works have been delayed due to travel restrictions imposed by the authorities at the height of the Covid-19 health crisis.

The facility, located approximately 6km downstream of the confluence of the Gwayi and Shangani Rivers (tributary of the Zambezi River), will be capable of storing 634 million m3 of water. With the lifting of sanitary restrictions, CWE plans to commission the reservoir in 2022. Phase two of the project involves the construction of an intake in the new dam. The raw water will follow the new pipes, the laying of which was recently launched by the Zimbabwean authorities. The pipelines will bring water to Bulawayo. The government upon the project completion, plans to treat this water for households and send some of the raw water to feed irrigation systems in the arid Matabeleland region.
