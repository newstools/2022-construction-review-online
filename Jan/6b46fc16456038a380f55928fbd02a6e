Social housing provider L&Q and developer Countryside have been offered planning to complete the £800m Acton Gardens housing estate phase 9 renovation in West London. Plans for the 215 mixed-tenure homes at the old South Acton estate were backed by Ealing Council planners. Phases 9.3, 9.5 and 9.6 of Acton Gardens were granted planning approval and the redevelopment is expected to start in July. The site completes the Enfield Road Character region, which acts as the gateway to Acton Gardens from Bollo Lane and Acton Town station. The £800m investment redevelopment project on a 52-acre largescale at the former South Acton estate will create around 3,500 new mixed-tenure homes. The project delivers 50% affordable housing and more social rent houses that earlier existed on the estate before the scheme started. The newly approved homes forms the three phases of the masterplan set to start in the summer and the first completion will be in 2024.
