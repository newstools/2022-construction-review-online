The agency is also planning to examine the mapping of land use, space, and development affected by the project’s infrastructure, the characterization of the acoustic environment in the surrounding area of the station sites, as well as the industrial development project in the study area. In addition, an environmental impact study relating to the future power line (400 KV) over approximately 55 km from the existing Chammaia-Laaouamer line will be carried out based on the requirements of sustainable development and the guidelines adopted by the Office.
