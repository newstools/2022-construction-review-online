With a single runway that has a length of 2,300 meters, the 100,000 passengers per year Tetouan Sania Ramel Airport serves Tétouan, a city in the Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region in Morocco, is set for expansion. This came into light following the selection of architect Zakaria Errafii by Office National Des Aéroports (ONDA), the Moroccan Airports Authority, to carry out the planning and monitoring of work on the project. Zakaria Errafii was selected out of a dozen applicants including Tarik Oualalou, the Youssef Lahkim / Youssef Fassi-Fihri consortium, and Groupe 3 Architects or Kahlaoui et Associés Architectes. With an estimated budget of close to US$ 12M the Tetouan Sania Ramel Airport expansion project will be a fee rate proposed by the architect and finally retained at 4%. The project involves the construction of a passenger terminal on a 5,000-square-meter piece of land. The terminal will host facilities such as a public hall, inspection sections, sorting and baggage delivery area, check-in, customs control, border police, and boarding rooms.
