 VolkerFitzpatrick will begin working on a £6m contract to revamp the Gloucestershire Airport runway this January. The project which is to be carried out in four phases will mainly focus on resurfacing main runways and the crosswind. A new runway lighting will be developed as well as signage and drainage upgrades and the below ground infrastructure installation for a new radar system. Ridge & Partners is the project manager.  One of the three airport runways will remain open while work continues on the others but will be operating at reduced capacity. Upon completion, the existing ‘north/south’ airport runway will close permanently to pave way for a new business park development, CGX Connect.  Work was started in November by Montel Civil Engineering on the access and services for the CGX Connect. The airport is located in Staverton, between Cheltenham and Gloucester. Read also: Plans approved for £800m London Acton Gardens New phase. The first phase works, commencing in January 2022, will lead to resurfacing of the crosswind runway. The work will be taking place throughout the night to minimise impact on airport’s day operations. The second and the third phase will follow later in spring 2022, with work will be ongoing during the day and  night to get it completed earliest possible. The phases will see the main runway get resurfaced, installation of new runway lighting and ground infrastructure as well as upgrades to signage and draining. The last will be the project’s testing and commissioning phase, so as to resume the normal operations by Summer 2022.  Kevin Berry, the VolkerFitzpatrick’s operations director stated: “We’re well versed in working on such projects, having done similar works at Birmingham, Glasgow and Gatwick Airports. These renovations will firmly place Gloucestershire Airport at the highest point of aviation standards and technology, which will help unlock great opportunities and benefits for the airport and its neighborhood.”
