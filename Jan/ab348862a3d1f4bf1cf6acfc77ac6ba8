Construction of the Skybox 30 MW data center in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, has been completed as announced by officials who said the facility is a retrofit of an existing warehouse owned by Prologis and was under construction for six months. The company originally formally announced the project in March last year, along with the sale of its 26MW Houston One plant in Texas to Element Critical. The facility is powered by Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd). In the previous year, the energy business claimed it was involved in bringing six data centers to Illinois, as well as bringing a new substation in the area online.

Elk Grove is already a significant midwestern data center hub. Stream Data Centers revealed plans for a second facility in Elk Grove late last year, Microsoft is presently constructing a data center in the vicinity, and T5 announced plans for a new facility in Elk Grove Technology Park in January 2020. Prime Data Centers revealed plans for a new 150MW site in Elk Grove towards the end of last year as well. The company stated that it intends to invest around US$1 billion in the development of a 750,000 square foot, 150MW site with three three-story structures. “We are excited to open our newest data center located in the area, which provides sustainable, innovative, and customizable turn-key and powered shell solutions to our enterprise and hyperscale clients in Chicago and around the country,” said Rob Morris, CEO of Skybox Datacenters. “Skybox’s major investment strengthens our image as a regional hub for high-tech business development and innovation.” Elk Grove Village would not be able to recruit world-class data center operators like Skybox without the increased power capacity offered by ComEd via proactive infrastructure investment in our town,” stated Elk Grove Village Mayor Craig Johnson.
