Construction plans for a new medical complex at Indiana University (IU) Health in southwest Fort Wayne, Indiana, have been released. The Department of Planning Services has received a Rezoning Petition Application. It describes proposals to rezone Lower Huntington Road, northwest of the Lafayette Center Road exit, and a 137-acre property for a contemporary medical complex near I-69. The new medical facility’s site was chosen for its convenience. A medical office building is now under construction. According to Brian Bauer, president of IU Health Fort Wayne, this is the only project that is currently in the works for the “near future.” Also Read: Construction to begin on The Lofts at Headwaters Park, Indiana “Most of it was already designated, but there was a tiny section that needed to be zoned.” As a result, we went ahead and did it. “We’ve been meeting with our neighbors, our new neighbors in that region, and talking about how we can work together to make it a fantastic campus,” Bauer explained. Maps for at least nine more property areas were also included with the application. They include locations for future outpatient ambulatory care centers, professional and commercial space, and commercial development. “We brought physicians to Fort Wayne who wasn’t already here, and I think that’s been a godsend, because we’ve been able to attract, hire, and educate physicians so consumers have more alternatives and less waiting time to see their provider.” “Every location we’ve established has had a wonderful reaction, so we’ve chosen to continue to develop and serve our patients, serve our community, and fulfill the needs of people in need,” Bauer said. He went on to say that he believes the new facility will open at a vital juncture. According to the head of IU Health, the new facility will open late this year.
