Construction is in the offing for a 50 Megawatts solar power plant in Oyem, the capital of Woleu-Ntem province in northern Gabon. This was announced by the Central African country Ministry of Economy, Prospective, and Development Planning (Ministère De L’economie, De La Prospective Et De La Programmation Du Développement – Gabon). A delegation from AMEA Power, a subsidiary of United Arab Emirates-based Al Nowais Investments (ANI) that develops, owns, and operates thermal and renewable power projects in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, led by its Chairman and CEO, Hussain Al Nowais, visited the ministry and presented to the minister a proposal to build the power plant. Upon completion, the solar power plant in Oyem is expected to increase the energy supply in the country in order to meet the demand of industries and households, particularly in the regions of Woleu-Ntem and Ogooué-Ivindo.

This ambition is one of the objectives of the “zero diesel” program that has led to the construction of several solar power plants in the country including the hybrid solar power plant of Ndjolé, the solar power plants of Booué, Ovan, Mékambo, Medouneu, Bitam, Minvoul, and Makokou.
