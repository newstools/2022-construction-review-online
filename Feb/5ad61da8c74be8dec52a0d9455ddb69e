The key delivery partners have been named for the second set of Sellafield’s new integrated delivery team model covering essential work packages in the clean-up of the West Cumbria’s nuclear site. The two spots for Electrical & Instrumentation have been taken by NG Bailey and Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick, a framework worth £485-£600m over the 18-year life of the programme. The award marks the second Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick’s major success after winning a place in the company of  EJ Parker Technical Services on the heating, air conditioning, and ventilation, a framework consensus worth up to £250m. The pivotal delivery partner E&I package was assigned by the overarching Programme and Project Partners – a five-strong team of companies providing the massive cleanup. The PPP partnership comprises a number of partners KBR as the integration partner; Morgan Sindall Infrastructure as the civil construction management partner; Jacobs as the design and engineering partner; Doosan Babcock as the process construction management partner; and Sellafield. It has been obtained under a new Multi Project Procurement (MPP) model that inspires long-term alliance throughout the supply chain, upgraded project delivery. The MPP model will lead to the appointment of Key Delivery Partners to offer work packages securing everything from constructing fit-out, general civils, and groundworks, to steelwork and cladding.
