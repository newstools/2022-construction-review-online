The Ghanaian government makes a move to curb traffic congestion and number of deaths recorded along Accra-Kumasi highway. The government of Ghana has awarded contracts to eight local contractors to construct four bypasses on Accra-Kumasi highway that in turn will dualize the stretch between the two towns. Kennedy Osei Nyarko, the Chairman for the Committee on Roads and Transport in Ghana addressed the media in parliament that the project to construct the four bypasses on Accra-Kumasi highway is set to begin in March. The commencement of the project will result in the road getting diverted from towns like Konongo, Anyinam among others. The project is estimated to cost a total of 2 billion Ghanaian Cedi which will be funded by the government.
