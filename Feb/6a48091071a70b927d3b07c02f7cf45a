Egypt’s Light Rail Transit (LRT) System that connects El-Salam district in Cairo with the 10th of Ramadan city in Sharqia governorate through the New Administrative Capital (NAC) is expected to become operational in March 2022 according to Kamel El-Wazir, the Transport Minister of Egypt. The minister made the announcement after visiting a number of ongoing transportation projects, including the LRT system, in the company of Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and other state officials. Egypt’s LRT System project is being implemented in phases, the first of which will connect the new capital with the Adly Mansour station, a central metro interchange station in Cairo on the Cairo-Ismailia desert road, over a distance of 65.63 kilometers. The station will include an integrated transport complex featuring an LRT system, a railway station, a SuperJet bus station and a shuttle bus station, and a commercial investment zone, on an area of approximately 15 acres.

Egypt’s LRT System will undergo extensions in its phases 2 (3.18 km), 3 (18.5 km), and 4 (16 km), which will bring the total length of the infrastructure to 103.3 km with a total of 19 stations. During the tour, Madbouly followed up on the ongoing tests on the six-carriage trains for the LRT system, 12 of which have already been delivered out of 22 that will eventually be in operation, as well as a diesel-powered locomotive that will be used for workshop activities. The remaining trains, designed to move at a speed of 120 km/hour, are being shipped by the international Chinese consortium of CREC-AVIC INTL.   The cost of the entire rolling stock is approximately US$ 227M.
