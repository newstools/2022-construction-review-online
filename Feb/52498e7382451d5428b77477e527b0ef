Far East Consortium (FEC) International Limited, a leading regional conglomerate specializing in property development, hospitality, car parking ventures, and gaming and entertainment in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Continental Europe has been awarded planning permission for Ensign House, a 56-storey residential tower at Canary Wharf in London Docklands. Designed by Maccreanor Lavington Architects, an award-winning architectural practice established in the early nineties by Gerard Maccreanor and Richard Lavington, the Ensign House will stand 230m high, on the north side of Marsh Wall next to Aspen at Consort Place, the other FEC’s Canary Wharf tower that is set for completion in 2024. The initial work on the Ensign House project could begin hopefully before the end of the current year. The entire project is expected to take approximately four years to complete, allowing the tower to open before the end of 2026.
