Kansas-based Hunt Midwest recently broke ground on the Fort Prince Logistics Center, an industrial project that will be the first speculative project by the commercial real estate company in Lyman and the South Carolina region at large. The aim of the project mainly is to offer future tenants or users maximum flexibility for their logistics, manufacturing, and distribution needs.

Seamon Whiteside is the project’s civil engineer while LS3P and  Evans General Contractors are the project’s architect and contractor respectively. The leasing arrangements are being handled by John Montgomery, Garrett Scott, Brockton Hall, and Dillon Swayngim of Colliers. Upon completion, expectedly by Q4 2022, the Fort Prince Logistics Center will feature a 135-foot-deep truck court; 48 dock positions, each having 36-foot clear heights; mechanical dock equipment; LED lighting with motion-sensors; ESFR fire sprinkler systems; up to 125 parking lots for trailers; and 189 surface parking stalls with additional space to allow for an expansion of up to 385 stalls. According to Michael Bell, the  Senior V.P for Hunt Midwest’s commercial real estate, the site selection for the Fort Prince Logistics Center was decided based on the availability of a highly skilled labor force in South Carolina. Bell also mentioned that the facility was strategically positioned at a location that is in close proximity to Interstate 85, Inland Port Greer, GSP International Airport, including BMW’s facilities and FedEx. A wide range of tenants would profit from the Fort Prince Logistics Center’s capacity to reach about 244 million customers within two days of shipping.
