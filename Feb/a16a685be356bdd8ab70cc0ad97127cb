The Hwange Local Board (HLB), through secretary Ndumiso Mdlalose, has revealed that the Hwange Local Board plans to begin the implementation of a huge housing project dubbed Empumalanga Phase 6, in EMpumalanga, Mpumalanga, South Africa. According to Mdlalose, the project would be built on an over 39000-acre piece of land sold to FBC Building Society, a mortgage finance institution mandated to mobilize savings and to promote homeownership in Zimbabwe, by HLB in 2018.

Recently FBC Building Society executives met with HLB management to discuss remaining concerns that the financial institution plans to fix before beginning building at its allotted territory. The Society required HLB to commit to an agreement made when the land was purchased. The HLB according to Mdlalose agreed to develop offsite infrastructure, including a surfaced access road, water and sewer main line, and an access bridge connecting Empumalanga Phase 3 and Empumalanga phase 6. HLB will also build a major sewage trunk to serve the new community, which includes Empumalanga Phase 4. The FBC Building Society plans to start its project this year.
