Meta Platforms, Inc., doing business as Meta and formerly known as Facebook, Inc. has announced plans to construct a 960,000-square-foot Kuna Data Center in Idaho at an approximated cost of US$ 800M. The facility will be situated next to the cross streets of Kuna Mora Road and South Cole Road, according to Cody Allred, the public information officer with the Idaho Department of Commerce. Officials at the American multinational technology conglomerate based in Menlo Park, California, reportedly thought of Kuna as a perfect area because of its access to renewable energy, infrastructure, community partners as well as a talent pool. The construction works are anticipated to begin in September 2022 and last through 2025. The project according to Tom Kealey, Idaho’s Department of Commerce director will directly offer 100 jobs, and 1,200 jobs will be available at peak construction.

It will also be the earliest scheme to exploit the state’s new tax breaks – and the first to deploy Idaho Power’s clean energy tariff. Other than the construction of the Kuna Data Center in Idaho, the US$ 800M investment according to Darcy Nothnagle,  the director of global data center community and economic development at Meta, will also extend to develop local infrastructure as well as construct wastewater and sewer infrastructure. Other investments the company will be adding include a “community action grants program” that will help STEM education, as well as funding water restoration schemes to “replenish watersheds.”  “We’re delighted to be here in Idaho and we anticipate having a great cooperation for years to come,” said Nothnagle.
