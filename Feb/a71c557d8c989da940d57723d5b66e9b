A US$ 100M project for the redevelopment of the Indiana Campus View Apartment Complex at the University of Notre Dame campus, is set to begin as soon as summer this year. Campus Living, a branch of Toll Brothers that designs, builds, markets, sells, and arranges to finance residential and commercial properties in the United States, plans to demolish the old 193-unit property south of Vaness Street and replace it with a new 328-unit apartment development. However, officials must still review final project plans to ensure that everything from construction to drainage and utilities meets current standards, but this shouldn’t cause too much of a delay because the developer has been working closely with the city for several months, according to Tim Corcoran, South Bend’s director of planning. The proposed complex will consist of a number of three-story buildings with a mix of studios and one- to four-bedroom flats, as well as a 312-story parking garage for residents. The new facility may also be appealing to visiting teachers, alumni, advanced degree students, and professionals working in South Bend or for the university.

Councilman Troy Warner, D-4, is excited about the project since Toll Brothers will be replacing an old building built in the 1960s with something newer and far more affluent. “It’s a fantastic and exciting investment for South Bend. It will create a lot of construction jobs and boost the city’s revenue base,” Warner said adding that, the new project is expected to earn three times the amount of taxes as the current Campus View, and the extra funds would be utilized to support other services and projects.
