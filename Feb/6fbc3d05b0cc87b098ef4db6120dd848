Plans are underway for the construction of a new Tritium EV Charger Facility in Tennessee, approximately 30 miles east of Nashville in Lebanon, according to Tritium DCFC Limited, an Australian-based global leader in the production of (Electric Vehicle) EV fast chargers. According to Jane Hunter, the Tritium CEO, the facility would be developed as a cutting-edge facility aimed at supporting the global growth of the e-mobility industry in the U.S. It will be equipped with six production lines and Tritium’s award-winning RTM and brand new PKM150 models, and it will produce up to 30,000 EV chargers that comply with the applicable Buy America Act provision, per year. Compliance with the applicable Buy America Act provision is one of the requirements for domestic sourcing under the Federal Highway Administration. This Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will provide a US$ 7.5bn investment for the deployment of 500,000 EV chargers along highway corridors in the U.S. This Tritium EV Charger Facility in Tennessee will be Tritium’s first location in the U.S, and the company will be working together with the U.S. Federal government and the State of Tennessee, in a bid to expand EV charging infrastructure in the North African country.
