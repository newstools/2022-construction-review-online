The family-owned real estate corporation Cimmarusti Holdings has announced that they are aiming to break ground on the construction of the tallest residential building, Lucia Park, in Glendale, Los Angeles, in early August this year. This is after the Glendale Design Review Board reviewed and approved the latest plans for the 24-story, 294-unit apartment development which is designed by JFAK Architects. It will be built on an approximately 1.5-acre site located at 625 N. Maryland Avenue, just east of North Brand Boulevard and south of the 134 Freeway.

Upon completion, Lucia Park will feature, 247 one-bedroom units and 47 two-bedrooms, along with 373 subterranean parking spaces for residential use and 129 above-ground replacement parking spaces for the site’s bank building. It will also provide publicly accessible open space in the form of a courtyard and plaza facing North Brand Boulevard, as well as residential amenity spaces and decks. The proposed residential amenities include an outdoor pool, a dog park, tables and seating furniture, fire pits, landscape planters (some of which will have shade trees), and other features. The building’s two largest decks on the other hand will feature a fourth-level pool deck and a nearly 10,000-square-foot rooftop terrace. At a height of 266-foot, the skyscraper will be one of several high-rise buildings planned for Downtown Glendale.
