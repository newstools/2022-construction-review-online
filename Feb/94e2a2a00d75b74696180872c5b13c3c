IndyGo will break ground on the Purple Line, Indianapolis’ newest bus rapid transit line, in March. The route will run from downtown Indianapolis to Ivy Tech Community College in Lawrence, near the intersection of Post Road and 56th Street. The Purple Line is scheduled to take two years to build, with a completion date of about March 2024. The line has a budget of roughly US$188 million. The construction of this 15.2-mile transit line, which will connect Indy to Lawrence with public transportation buses, as well as important infrastructural enhancements, will be a mammoth endeavour.

According to IndyGo spokesperson Carrie Black, the project will impact almost 60,000 Hoosiers who reside in the 38th Street corridor. “We are doing everything we can to educate the people.” To keep them up to speed and to teach them what to look for and what to expect. The first significant closure, where they’ll begin turning earth to physically build the groundwork for the Purple Line, will take place on or after March 1st, so it’s just a few weeks away! We want to keep the public informed of what is going to happen and when.” The project is the second phase of IndyGo’s ambition to introduce three additional bus rapid transit lines to the neighborhood. The Red Line is currently the only one that is finished. With four in-person townhalls along the Purple Line route, IndyGo is striving to ensure that anybody affected by Purple Line construction gets their issues answered before construction begins. Visitors will get a rundown of what the Purple Line will look like, as well as how construction will affect businesses, vehicles, and IndyGo users, during the open houses.
