As it continues to invest record amounts in its fleet, Selwood, the UK leader in pump rental solutions, has agreed a new partnership with Borger. The arrangement commences with Selwood’s purchase of 15 custom-designed, positive displacement process-critical pumps to complement its existing stock of 5,000 pumps for rental; primarily in water and wastewater applications. Selwood and Borger have worked together for several years on a number of key sites, with this first official order being for Borger to provide its proven BLUEline Maintenance-In-Place pumps in three sizes; from 7.5kW up to 30kW; protected in stackable crash-frames. Mark Bebbington, Group Technical Solutions Director at Selwood, said: “As the UK’s leader in pump rental solutions and pump manufacture, we are committed to continual investment in our fleet. Over the years, we’ve seen how Borger’s macerators and rotary lobe pumps can complement our own stock; supporting our reputation for providing customers with exceptional products and service. Borger’s reliability, easy servicing and backup we receive from their teams are also important factors”. “This new agreement support’s Selwood’s ability to provide the best possible solutions for our customers, including major water authorities across the UK”. David Brown, Managing Director of Borger UK, added: “Our companies work very well together, with a similar ethos. We look forward to strengthening what is already a very strong collaboration”. The 15 new Borger pumps (five of each size), have been designed and supplied to WIMES specification. Fitted with dry run, discharge pressure and suction monitoring, they are all compatible with Selwood Pumps’ in-house designed telemetry site monitoring system, SelWatch.
