Meikles Hotel announced that it would conduct a three-phased significant renovation project to preserve its dominance in Zimbabwe’s hospitality industry, but only after receiving City of Harare clearance. The multi-million-dollar renovation of Harare’s five-star hotel is expected to take two years, divided into three phases, according to the general manager Mr Tinashe Munjoma. He stated that the hotel was seeking to boost its accessibility and exposure by providing consumers with convenient access.

Mr Munjoma stated that the rebuilding effort will entail extensive reconstruction of critical districts. The improvements will include the installation of a suspended pool on the mezzanine floor adjacent to the La Fontaine, which will take up to nine months. The foyer will be renovated and changed into a 24-hour restaurant during Phase 2, which will take roughly five months. The rooms in the south wing will be renovated in Phase 3. Mr Mujoma explained that because they cannot close the hotel fully, the renovations would be done in phases over a two-year period. ASB Hospitality of Dubai purchased Meikles two years ago. The hotel was originally part of Meikles Limited’s hospitality division, but its sale to new Dubai-based owners in 2020 marked a significant upgrade program that is planned to improve existing food and beverage services, as well as the hotel’s ageing physical and service operations. Meikles Hotel was opened in 1915 as a double-storey structure along Sam Nujoma Street and Jason Moyo Avenue, with a tower block added in 1958 and a second tower block added in 1976. Major projects have been carried out between 1993 and 2013 in an effort to allow the hotel to stay up with worldwide travel standards and styles. These include remodelling, extension, and restoration projects.
