The 300m first phase extension of West Midlands Metro, a light-rail/tram system in the county of West Midlands, England,  has been completed. This achievement marks an important step forward for the light rail scheme slated to be the largest of its kind in the UK. The 11km extension will split off the former West Midlands Metro line on the east of Wednesbury Great Western Street Metro stop, before stretching through Tipton and Dudley up to Brierley Hill. There is an idea of up to 16 metro stops, with two additional stops provided. After the victorious installation of the first part of the track, the Midland Metro Alliance team, which is designing and constructing the line on behalf of Transport for West Midlands (TfWM), is currently welding the rail into place. The Midland Metro Alliance comprises the West Midlands Combined Authority, which is the owner of West Midlands Metro, a design specialists consortium from Egis, Tony Gee, and Pell Frischmann; and rail construction experts Colas Rail, Barhale, Bouygues as well as Auctus Management Group.

There is much work that goes on outside of the public eye and the recent rail installation really does bring this scheme to life.” The West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street added: “This is a crucial milestone for the residents of Dudley and the Black Country as it means that we are one step closer to unlocking the great benefits this Metro extension will offer to the region. It will create better links to the East and West of Birmingham by tram and excitingly it will also offer a direct route to HS2 – connecting Dudley and Sandwell with other parts of the UK beyond the West Midlands.” All things being well, the metro extension is planned to open for commuters in 2024.
