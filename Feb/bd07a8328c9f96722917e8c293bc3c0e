Sunray Group has proposed constructing a new 164-unit residential complex in a site located at 1296 Kennedy Road between Lawrence Avenue East and Ellesmere Road in Scarborough’s Dorset Park district, Toronto, USA. The site for the proposed 9-storey Mataj Architects-designed building that has a planned total gross floor space of 11,617m2 is currently occupied by a one-storey old car wash structure, while the remainder of the brownfield site is undeveloped. The proposal is reportedly being considered after applications for Zoning By-Law Amendment and Site Plan Approval are filed to the City on December 30th, 2021. The Sunray Group 164-unit residential complex shall offer a range of housing alternatives, from studio units to three bedrooms. It is intended to feature a T-shape with a rear wing that makes a transition from nine to three stories, respecting the low-rise neighborhood to its west.

The surrounding environment is rather heterogeneous, with mostly residential to the west and mostly business across Kennedy Road to the east. It also includes two levels of underground parking with a total of 156 spaces. According to the Planning Rationale, Sunray Group sees the Sunray Group 164-unit residential complex project as a method for the City of Toronto to meet the area’s planned population expansion, and they hope that the development’s compact and urban-type of housing will be a selling point for the City. This project would also provide a transition between the present land uses in the region, particularly with the predominantly commercial/industrial sector on the other side of Kennedy Road. Sunray believes that it will complement the existing set of Kennedy Road and serve as a good transition to a broader development in the neighborhood.
