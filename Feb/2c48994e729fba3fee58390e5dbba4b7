The ongoing construction of the close to US$ 6M Narok River bridge near the Narok GK Prison is expected to be completed within the next three months. This came into light after the County Development and Implementation Coordination Committee (CDICC) visited the project site to examine the bridge the construction of which began in December of last year. Narok County Commissioner Isaac Masinde, who led the CDICC requested the Sinoe Construction Company, which is building the 21 meters deep and 8 meters broad bridge, to adhere to the agreed-upon schedules and to perform excellent work so that the bridge may serve future generations. The Narok River bridge construction project is one of the important projects that are being carried out in the town by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) alongside the improvement of the bitumen standard on 3.6 kilometers of Kims Breeze-Polong’a road, 1.96 kilometers of Olmarei Lang’ road, 0.74 kilometers of ENSDA-Africa Hope road, and 0.6 kilometers of the county commissioner’s home circle road.

Masinde said that while the bridge will give an alternate route to the Maasai Mara University for the county commissioner’s office, county government offices, county assembly, and members of the public who seek services from the offices upon completion, the road’s will help decrease traffic jams in Narok town since cars will be able to quickly connect to the Narok-Bomet Highway. According to the commissioner, the CDICC will return to the construction site by the end of March to assess the level of work completed. He went on to say that the government only hires contractors who are capable of doing the job and this is why he expected the contractor to finish the task within the agreed timeline.
