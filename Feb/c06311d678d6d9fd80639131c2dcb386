The Brickworks, a commercial and logistics park project developed by Investec Property Development is set to be carried out in Umhlanga at the disused 157 ha Corobrik site in Durban’s northern motorway corridor. Already approved by the KwaZulu-Natal government, the project which is set to be implemented in three phases will see 1.7 million cubic meters of the earth moved to create extensive platforms that will allow for the construction of warehouses, up to 100 000 m2 under roof. The first phase according to Iain Burns, the Brickworks development manager from Investec Property will result in approximately 150 000 m2 of gross lettable area (GLA). Once all three phases have been developed, The Brickworks will measure in excess of 450 000 m2 of GLA.

According to joint CEO David Rosmarin, the move is a statement of confidence in the future of KZN and South Africa. While the property market has been tested by the epidemic and lockdowns, Rosmarin claims that industrial property, particularly warehouse and logistics facilities, has shown to be robust. Rosmarin stated that the property was unusually well positioned and that the logistics park and its proximity to key arterial and alternative road networks provided users with a strategic advantage. Large infrastructure enhancements and top-structure developments would provide significant employment creation prospects. The revitalization of the manufacturing site will provide continued, long-term economic stimulation to KwaZulu-Natal. The Brickworks, according to Rosmarin, was also a triumph for eThekwini since it was part of the city’s Economic Development Incentive Policy, which helped investment in the city and contributed to job creation.
