President Paul Kagame and First Lady Jeannette Kagame broke ground on the Bwiza Riverside affordable housing project, a new eco-friendly housing project in Kigali’s Nyarugenge District, developed through a partnership between Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and ADHI Corporate Group. RDB is a government department that integrates all government agencies responsible for the attraction, retention, and facilitation of investments in the national economy while ADHI is a Gabonese construction firm founded more than a decade ago. ADHI proposes to build around 2400 housing units in five phases using a new innovative process and also utilizing tried-and-true technology and materials that when combined result in constructions that are faster, cheaper, stronger, and that last longer. According to ADHI Chairman Soleman Idd, weather, earthquake damage, wind and fire, rust, corrosion, and humidity have little effect on constructed houses.

According to officials, the Bwiza Riverside affordable housing project is expected to cost more than US$ 100M. The developers say that the project’s building processes and community layouts would be environmentally friendly, owing to patented construction technology that utilizes factory-made modular elements for “plug-and-play” construction. The solution saves homes up to 53% on-site energy and money in the long term. Bwiza Riverside will also employ green infrastructure to produce a sustainable neighborhood with a low carbon footprint.
