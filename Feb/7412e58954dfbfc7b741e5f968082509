Hwange Local Board (HLB) has donated 17 hectares of land to the Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Ministry for the development of a college in Hwange. This was announced last week by Ndumiso Mdlalose, town secretary of the Hwange Local Board, who stated that the site will be used to build Hwange teachers and polytechnic institutions.

This led the ministry to approach the council once more, this time in search of further property for the development of a teachers college and a polytechnic. According to him, the Hwange Local Board then agreed to the ministry’s proposal and decided to set aside 17ha for the project. Mdlalose stated that the anticipated building of teachers’ and polytechnic institutions is a significant milestone not only for Hwange but for Matabeleland North province as a whole. He stated that the province’s lack of a college made it difficult for students to pursue professional professions and that having learning institutions in Hwange may boost economic activity in the area. Massive infrastructure development is expected, with the construction of dwellings standing out as the need for housing skyrockets. The development will also result in massive job creation in numerous areas of the economy, while commercial activity is likely to skyrocket. Last year, Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Richard Moyo stated that the construction of the teachers’ college will be the government’s first major initiative in Matabeleland North this year. Since independence, the province has depended on instructors taught at United College of Education, Hillside Teachers College in Bulawayo, and Joshua Mqabuko Polytechnic College in Gwanda.
