South Korean pipe producer SeAH Wind has revealed its plan to invest close to US$ 406M in Teesside’s monopile factory which will be the largest of its kind in the world. Work will begin in July on the company’s 90-acre tract that lies alongside the under-development South Bank Quay. The project will generate 750 direct jobs and 1,500 more in the supply chain and construction phase. Earlier stated, SeAH intended to construct the facility at the Able Marine Energy Park on the Humber Estuary. It stated that due to “business reasons” completing an agreement for Humberside has been a stalemate. The huge monopile steel tubes will establish the foundations for wind turbines meant to create the world’s largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank. The project will be fully completed in 2026, it is set to be able to generate between 100 and 150 monopiles annually.

Recently, the first phase of the quay was assigned finances amounting to US$ 144.81M in the UK Infrastructure Bank’s first-ever investment. Piling to reinforce the quay wall is now taking place, with the full phase one 450m quay set to be completed by March 2023. Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley Mayor stated: “2022 is our year of building and this is another transformational scheme that positions Teesside as the lead for clean, green manufacturing in the UK. Initial works for the monopile factory will begin early in July. We’re wasting no time in clearing land and developing projects like the South Bank Quay, which has demonstrated a massive draw to SeAH as it is for other businesses in the offshore industry.
