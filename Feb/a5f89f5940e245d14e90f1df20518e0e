The Federal Government of Nigeria is looking to speed up the construction of the Royal Palace Museum in Benin, which is also known as King Toffa’s Palace and more recently Musée Honmé according to Prof. Abba Tijani, the Director-General, National, Commission for Museums and Monuments. This comes after President Muhammadu Buhari handed artifacts worth close to US$ 3.4M to Oba of Benin, approximately 125 years after the artifacts were stolen by British troops when they invaded the Benin kingdom. So far a cockerel (okpa) has been repatriated from Cambridge University and the Oba head (Uhunwun Elao) from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. Prof. Tijani urged the stakeholders to cooperate towards the retrieval of more artifacts adding that for the artifacts to survive when they are brought in, they will need to construct solid structures like the royal palace museum in both Abuja and Benin City. The Prof. went on to encourage everyone to visit museums, especially the youth so that they learn their pasts and also understand their culture.
