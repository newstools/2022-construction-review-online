A collaboration of solar company Hive Hydrogen and South African investment organization Built Africa and German chemical company, Linde plc, decided to come together and establish the massive export plant in Nelson Mandela Bay in South Africa. It is said that the project will have US$4 billion when it comes to capex cost. It will also possess its dedicated power supply from a neighboring 1GE solar-powered project, courtesy of Hive Energy. When solar power is limited, the project will still have access to a 1.4GW wind plant facility. The largest green ammonia plant is forecasted to have a production capacity of more than about 800,000 tons a year. During the projects televised launch, Hive Hydrogen Chairman, Thulani Gcabashe, expresses the following, “For context, current total global capacity is estimated at roughly 180,000 tons per annum,”He further expressed that he wanted to create a “center of excellence” for ammonia production within the region.

The studies revealed that the first phase is set to go live by the year 2025, whilst the full operation is expected to commence by the end of the year 2026. Working Together:Both Hive Hydrogen and Linde plc have the common goal and aim of capitalizing on the ever-growing demand for ammonia on a global scale to meet the current standards/requirements of the chemical and mining as well as agricultural sectors. One unique aspect of the largest green ammonia plant project is its method of combining green hydrogen with nitrogen to form green ammonia. This method has been remarked as a key player in decarbonizing heavy industries across the whole world.
