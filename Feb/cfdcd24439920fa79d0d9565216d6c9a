H2 Industries, a hydrogen energy and H2 supply solutions company based in the United States of America has revealed that it has received preliminary approval from the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone), a global investment hub and a dynamic export platform that is managed by the General Authority for the Suez Canal Economic Zone, for the construction of the first waste-to-hydrogen plant in Egypt. The 1 GW facility will be constructed particularly in East Port Said, and it will produce 300, 000 tonnes of hydrogen each year at half the cost of current production technologies while consuming 4M tonnes of organic waste and non-recyclable plastics in the process.

The hydrogen can then be economically extracted and converted to electrical energy. Michael Stusch, the executive chairman of H2-Industries said that the project, the cost of which is approximately 3M will be carried out in three phases, the last of which is expected to be completed within a period of five years. “This is an exciting opportunity and one that will take the tonnes of waste collected in Egypt and turn it into green hydrogen. The facility is also a breakthrough in making green hydrogen economically viable, helping reduce not only global CO2 emissions but also reducing the pollution and impairment of water resources in the North African country,” explained the H2-Industries executive chairman.
