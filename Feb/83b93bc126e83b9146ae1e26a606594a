Plans to convert a surface parking lot at Hollywood and Highland, Los Angeles, in order to build The Bonnie, a mixed-use complex, have passed a major obstacle. The Los Angeles City Council decided to grant The Bonnie, a proposed mixed-use project behind the El Capitan Theatre, a sustainable communities project exemption, exempting the proposal from further evaluation under the California Environmental Quality Act. The 6831 Hawthorn Avenue project includes the construction of an eight-story structure with 137 apartments, 1,200 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, and an underground parking garage. The Bonnie, designed by Nadel Architects, is depicted in drawings as a modern podium-type structure with an L-shaped footprint enclosing a pool deck. Other proposed amenities include a rooftop deck and a gym.

In return for larger floor space and other benefits, 14 flats would be set aside for extremely low-income people to rent. Michael Nazzal is the project’s developer, and his family bought the parking lot directly south of the El Capitan Theatre more than 30 years ago. The Bonnie is located in a popular area of Hollywood, surrounded by similar mixed-use complexes as well as bigger commercial structures. A block north, Gaw Capital USA and DJM are in the midst of a US$100 million makeover of the Hollywood & Highland Center, which would turn the top floors of the fortress-like facility into rentable offices. A short walk south, along Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, Harridge Development Group recently acquired a US$485 million construction financing for Crossroads Hollywood, a multi-tower complex.
