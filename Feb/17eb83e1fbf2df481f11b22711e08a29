A sustainable groundwater management project in Mauritania, that aims to exploit aquifers in the northern regions of the Northwest African country that are not yet dry, has been approved by the  Ministry of Water and Sanitation in collaboration with the United States Greeeological Survey. The US government will avail US$ 9.5M to the United States Geological Survey, which is responsible for water, land, biological sciences, and citizen mapping over a period of 22 months to finish the five components of the water supply project in Mauritania.

At first, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) will utilize remote sensing tools to identify zones where aquifers can be found then carry out a hydrogeological appraisal of Adrar, northern Tiriz-Zamaur, and Tagant regions. Both the United States Geological Survey and the Mauritania officials will carry out an economic assessment of groundwater development and sustainable usage in pertinent zones later to facilitate science-based decision-making on sustainable groundwater management projects in north Mauritania before proposals for groundwater framework monitoring are made. The sustainable groundwater management project in Mauritania will be essential to construct the capacity of Mauritanian specialists working within the water sector and to encourage the transfer of technology. The US Embassy in Mauritania stated that this will clearly permit the scientific community composed of Mauritanian engineers and technicians, well prepared in hydrology, to evaluate, create and oversee water resources in a sustainable and independent manner to the advantage of the people of Mauritania.
