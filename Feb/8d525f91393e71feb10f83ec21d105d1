Construction of the first phase of a US$ 1bn campus and biotechnology center Project, named Aggie Square in Sacramento, is set to begin following a groundbreaking ceremony held at the University of California Davis (UC Davis). This phase will be developed on an 8-acres piece of land that is currently occupied by a parking lot along Second Avenue and Stockton Boulevard. As part of the project, the existing parking lot will be converted into a modern innovation center in the city. The entire project includes the development of 1.2 million square feet of research labs, wet labs, retail spaces, and housing units across five different buildings. Two of the buildings will be built as Biotechnology research buildings, one will be the Alice Waters Institute for Edible Education. The other buildings will consist of classrooms dedicated to job training and lifelong learning, along with a mixed-use housing development.

The result will be a unique live/learn/work/play environment that values inclusion and creates chance encounters among creative people. The actual construction works are expected to begin by April this year, and the center’s opening date is scheduled for 2025. Upon completion, Aggie Square Innovation hub is expected to create up to 25,000 jobs and generate about US$ 5bn for the economy of the region annually. The center will also provide a platform for cutting-edge work in life science, technology, and health communities, according to UC Davis Chancellor Gary May, offer the city a more diverse economy, and provide support for Startups and new business launches.
