Johnston Bombers golf & entertainment complex, another Topgolf style driving range and restaurant, is in the works for the Des Moines metro area on 5055 Merle Hay Road just north of Interstate 80/35. Generally, the complex will be a four-story, 45,000-square-foot arena with 60 climate-controlled hitting bays from which golfers may smash into a 245-yard driving range. A full-service restaurant, numerous themed bars, an interactive video sports section, an arcade, and a rooftop bar are also a part of the proposal.
