The Air Force Academy’s plans to develop a new visitor centre are going forward in Colorado. The Academy met its private financial benchmarks last week, allowing construction to begin in the spring. It will be erected on 57 acres of Air Force land outside the Academy’s north gate. The mixed-use development will include over 190,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, as well as a 32,000-square-foot visitor centre and a 375-room hotel and conference centre. It is the final of four City for Champions initiatives aimed at boosting economic vitality and tourism in the Pikes Peak region.

Presentations showcasing Air Force and Space Force operations may be included in the great atrium. Hands-on activities may include glider controls linked to a hanging craft and a speed challenge test to allow guests to experience running at the local altitude. Other exhibitions will focus on the history and athletics of the Air Force Academy. The new Visitor Center will be recognized as a Colorado Welcome Center as well. A business centre, an outdoor pool and sun deck, a full-service spa, and a gift store are also available. “The Air Force Academy has long been a celebrated part of our city’s identity, and the Visitor Center will provide a fantastic opportunity to share it with residents and visitors alike. It’s difficult to imagine a more catalytic and impactful project with a more transformational effect on our City than the whole of the City for Champions initiative. I am grateful to the public and private partners and community members alike who put their hearts and souls into the City for Champions initiative to make it a reality,” said Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers.
