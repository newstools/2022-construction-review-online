A Courtyard by Marriott hotel is being built on Vista Drive in Pocatello, Idaho, and is scheduled to open in the spring of 2023. Rusty Landon, CEO of Inntrusted, which owns the upcoming hotel, stated that his business has received approval to construct the Marriott on Vista Drive in August 2021. According to Landon, the hotel will have a modern design, a swimming pool, a hot tub, a fitness facility, a lounge with a full liquor license, and city views. The Vista Drive region will gain a third Marriott hotel as a result of this initiative. Inntrusted also owns the Marriott Fairfield Inn & Suites in the area, as well as the Holiday Inn Express & Suites.

Landon stated that they will begin advertising for the posts this autumn. “We just noticed that Pocatello needed some modern merchandise and that the space could take it.” We really like the view from the top of the hill, and we think guests will like being able to see the Pocatello Valley. “We’re thrilled to have another hotel in Pocatello,” said Landon. “The city authorities in Pocatello have been fantastic to deal with. We’ve had a great time in Pocatello and with everyone we’ve met. It’s been fantastic. I believe guests will be impressed. “It’ll be a really beautiful and calm environment,” Landon said. While the Marriott Courtyard is being built, two existing hotels in the region — the Grand Idaho Inn & Suites and the Days Inn, respectively — are getting extensive renovations and upgrades. Further north in Pocatello, the former Clarion Inn at 1399 Bench Road has been renamed Grand Idaho Inn & Suites after being purchased by a consortium of local hoteliers. The Days Inn, previously the Rodeway Inn, at 835 S Fifth Ave., is undergoing extensive renovations to provide a more upscale overnight experience.
