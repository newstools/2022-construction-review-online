The Bono Regional Coordinating Council (BRCC) is currently making arrangements to officially hand over the transport terminal at Dormaa-Ahenkro to the chiefs and people of the area. Funded through the Ghana Secondary Cities Support Programme (GSCSP), the Transport Terminal at Dormaa-Ahenkro project was established to give adequate space for vehicle drivers at Dormaa-Ahenkro as a result of congestion at the Dormaa-Ahenkro old lorry station, which was causing transporters inconvenience. The project was implemented as part of the Ministry of Local Government Decentralisation and Rural Development Initiative that generally had the aim of improving  basic urban services and urban management in municipal districts that were involved. Other projects that are being carried out in the Dormaa Central Municipality include the construction of a market complex at Berekum and the installation of streetlights. The GSCSP is currently being executed in 25 chosen municipalities and metropolises across the state.
