Following its tenth year in the country and the opening of a new office and repair center in Cape Town in 2021, technology multinational Fujifilm South Africa has turned the first sod of the construction of a new Fujifilm head office in Sandton, which forms part of Fujifilm’s ongoing commitment to the country. Designed by Empowered Space Architects, the five-storey 999-square-meter structure featuring office space, a Fujifilm repair center, and, most crucially, the Fujifilm Technology Centre Africa, will be built at 18 Holt Street in accordance with the company’s group international climate action objectives of producing net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by the fiscal year ending March 2041. According to Fujifilm, the first energy-efficient solutions for the new building include the use of motion sensors and day/night lighting, energy-efficient plumbing that uses less water, rainwater harvesting, and the installation of solar panels on the roof.
