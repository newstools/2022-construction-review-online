A division of Vancouver’s Intracorp Homes, Intracorp Texas has revealed new renderings, designs, and project details for a new high-rise building, which will be home to the Conrad Residences & Conrad hotel. Located at 311 East Second and Trinity Street, just west of the Austin Convention center and Austin Marriott Downtown, this residential high-rise is reportedly the developer’s fourth project in Austin and it’s intended to become the tallest building of its kind at a height of 750 feet and 65 stories. The project is sectioned into two parts, which will house 330 hotel rooms on the first 26 floors of the building, and at the top floors that will contain 136 condo units, ranging from one to four bedrooms units. The residential high-rise will also feature about 11,000 Square feet on the ground floor for retail spaces, indoor/outdoor amenity spaces, as well as restaurants and bars. Intracorp has requested a downtown density bonus from the city, to allow for an increased floor-to-area ratio from 8:1 to 25:1; this would give the developers an extra 390,000 square feet of space, in addition to the 573,000 square feet allotted to the project. Intracorp is willing to pay up to US$ 4.8M in fees-in-lieu of affordable housing for this deal and also has plans of relocating Leonard and Vida East, a historic building currently located at 307 East Second Street to East Austin.

Compass Development Marketing Group, a division of Compass Inc., is handling sales and marketing for the residential units.
