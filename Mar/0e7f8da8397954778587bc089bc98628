Five Manhattan West, The lofts, Eugene tower, and the Pendry have been opened for public use and are fully operational. Two Manhattan West is the last of the six buildings still under construction and it recently topped out at 58-stories. Construction is expected to wrap up by 2023. Brookfield Properties has reportedly been working on this seven million square foot project, located between the Ninth and Tenth Avenues, for over 30 years, with the goal of connecting several neighborhoods in New York and transforming untapped spaces above the rail lines into new dynamic destinations. The site provides urban corridors starting from Penn Station, which continue heading West towards the Hudson River. It also includes a 2.5-acre James Corner Field Operation designed public plaza that connects all the buildings. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) designed the 2million square-foot Manhattan West twin towers, with the aim of meeting LEED Gold Certification standards. Together the towers form an entry point into the northeast and southeast corners of the site and their curving glass designs give the city’s skyline an elegant look. Their location is set back from Ninth Avenue and opposite Moynihan Train Hall, which is intended to create welcoming outdoor plazas.
