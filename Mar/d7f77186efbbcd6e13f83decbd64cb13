A groundbreaking ceremony was held recently for the implementation of the I-35 Southbound Project in Austin that involves the construction of entry and exit lanes on a portion of the Round Rock Interstate, between US 79 and SH 45 North in William County. Present at the groundbreaking ceremony were officials from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Williamson County, the City of Round Rock, and the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. Round Rock’s Mayor, Craig Morgan was thankful for the partnership and support from the TxDOT, on the I-35 Southbound Project in Austin that also involves moving the middle barrier, restriping the southbound I-35 main lanes, and installing high-mast lights throughout the corridor. JD Abrams L.P, a civil engineering and construction firm based in Texas, will serve as the contractor for the I-35 southbound project,  and construction work on this project is expected to be completed by the early part of next year, as long as weather conditions remain favorable. The US$ 8.4M I-35 southbound project in Austin is a part of the Texas Clear Lanes project, a TxDOT initiative that is intended to address the gridlock issues faced by drivers statewide. Tucker Ferguson, a TxDOT Austin District Engineer, pointed out that Austin’s I-35 usually gets jammed at almost all hours of the day.  Likewise, in a study by the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), I-35 was ranked 15th on the list of the 100 most congested roadways.
