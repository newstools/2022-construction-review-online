The construction of a new marine science facility in Oregon Clatsop College, that the school intends to use to cement its position as a major industrial and maritime technology hub in the Pacific Northwest, has begun. Designed by SRG Partnership, a full-service architecture, planning, and interiors firm based in Portland and Seattle, the 15,500-square-foot Maritime Science Building will house classrooms, offices, conference spaces, and other instructional and building support spaces for the college’s maritime science, coastal resources, environmental studies, scientific research training, manufacturing technologies careers, and technical programs. SRG Partnership’s design will integrate the building into the existing Marine and Environmental Research and Training Station (MERTS) campus and its natural surroundings, while also creating a destination and arrival point that strengthens the sense of place, and the maritime identity and brand.

The exposed bulk timber speaks to the marine motif while also paying homage to the region’s timber industry. In addition, the mass wood avoids the need for interior columns, keeping the space open and adaptable. The translucent atrium of the building encourages views from both inside and outside while a big perforated wood map depicts the Columbia River’s confluence with the Pacific Ocean. Generally, the design has a structural purpose in addition to its visual appeal.
