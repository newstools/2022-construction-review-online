The Elephant and Castle is the region around a major road junction in London, England, in the London Borough of Southwark where the wider Elephant and Castle project seeks to create a diversified new town center with housing, restaurants, stores, a university, workspace, leisure and cultural facilities, transportation infrastructure, and acres of the new public realm. The construction of the new town center is taking place in three phases, the first of which is already complete. The second phase began in October 2020 with the destruction of the current shopping center site, and development on-site is already ongoing.

The new plans for the redevelopment include:
