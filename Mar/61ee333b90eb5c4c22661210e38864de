Greenwich Council has approved the construction of Hyde’s 1200 Units at Charlton Riverside Scheme, a project to regenerate the 122 hectares area along the south bank of the River Thames at Charlton, London, that forms part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, into a mixed-use quarter, characterized by medium-rise housing and a significant proportion of family homes. The project for the construction of Hyde’s 1200 Units at Charlton Riverside Scheme will be carried out in phases, the first of which will deliver a total of 718 units upon completion expectedly in 2026. 263 of the 718 units will be set aside for London affordable rent, 133 for shared ownership, and 322 for private sale. Greenwich Council also granted preliminary approval for a further 494 units to be built in a later phase.

Hyde built a total of 651 new homes last year and began 1,926 more. Under the Homes England strategic partnership program, it has been assigned US$ 387.5M to build 3,000 homes and it has also agreed earlier this year with institutional investor M&G to fund a close to US$ 655M development pipeline to create 2,000 new shared ownership homes.
