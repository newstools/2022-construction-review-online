Plans are underway for the development of 3 new Springfield fire stations in Ohio, to replace some of the city’s aging fire service facilities that have been in use for decades. Two of the three stations will be built at Burt Street and South Limestone Street while the third station is yet to be decided, however, the city authorities are checking out the east side of Springfield. according to reports, later this month Springfield city commissioners will vote and make a decision on entering into an agreement with App Architecture LLC to begin the design phase of the new station on South Limestone Street. This contract is not expected to exceed US$350,000. This new South Limestone fire station, the construction of which is expected to commence by fall and be completed by late 2023, will replace the former Wendy’s station. The city hopes to have all 3 Springfield fire stations completed or almost ready by the year 2026.
