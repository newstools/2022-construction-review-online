The Abrahamic Family House project that is being carried out on Saadiyat island in Abu Dhabi the capital city of the United Arab Emirates is reportedly over 20% complete with the inauguration ceremony set to take place before the end of the year. This was revealed in a statement released by the Higher Committee Of Human Fraternity (HCHF), which is supervising the project that is closely followed by imam Ahmed el-Zayed of al-Azhar and Pope Francis who endorsed its overall design. The project drew inspiration from the 2019 Document on Human Fraternity and derived its name from Abraham, an old figure from the old testament in the Christian bible that is also equally revered by Muslims, Jews, and Christians. The Abrahamic Family House, completion of which is to set the establishment as a beacon of peaceful coexistence and understanding, will include everything from a church, to a mosque, and a synagogue.

Moses ben Maimon is described as an influential and prolific Jewish philosopher that was Sephardic during the middle ages. The Abrahamic Family House site will also include a cultural center that aims to motivate people to exemplify the human spirit of solidarity. The design of the Abrahamic Family House aimed to capture the values that are shared across Islam, Judaism, and as well as Christianity, was done by Adjaye Associates, an award-winning architectural and design firm with studios in Accra, London, and New York. The firm was led by Sir David Adjaye, a Ghanaian-British architect famous for designing many notable buildings around the world, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.
