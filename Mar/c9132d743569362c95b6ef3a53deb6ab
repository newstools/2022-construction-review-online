 The Africa Energy Forum 2022 will be held 21 – 24 June in Brussels under the theme ‘Africa for Africa: Building Energy for the Just Transition’, before starting our journey to Nairobi, Kenya, where we will host our 25th Africa Energy Forum. Once again we unite governments, utilities and regulators with development finance institutions, commercial banks, power developers, technology providers, EPCs and professional services. Over the last 23 years the Forum has earnt a reputation as the most meaningful gathering of decision-makers in African energy to form partnerships, identify opportunities and move the industry forward. We hand-pick the most credible organisations in the sector, delivering an intensive networking experience like no other.
