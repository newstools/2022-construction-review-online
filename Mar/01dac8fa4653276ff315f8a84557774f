The implementation of Western Villages at Granton Waterfront, Scotland’s Largest Net Zero Housing Project has been approved by the councilors elected to serve on the City Council of Edinburgh as part of the council’s over US$ 1.6bn Granton Waterfront rehabilitation plan. The project will be carried out by CCG (Scotland) Ltd, an industry leader for innovation in construction and one of the largest privately-owned construction and manufacturing companies in the United Kingdom country. CCG’s net-zero home standard will be utilized for the construction, with the council describing it as bringing improved insulation, low-carbon heating, and renewable technologies that will enable it to make “significant progress” in developing sustainable housing for its residents.

The project, designed by Cooper Cromar, a leading and multi-award-winning UK architectural practice that is also behind the concept for the region, will enjoy active mobility, electric car charging points, car club spaces, and public transportation links as well as sea vistas and neighboring parkland. According to the Edinburgh council over the next 15 years, the Granton Waterfront site will also be home to 3,500 net-zero carbon houses, a low energy heat network, a primary school, a health center, commercial and cultural spaces, sustainable transportation, and a new coastal park. The deputy leader of the City of Edinburgh Council Cammy Day stated, “Especially in light of COP26 and our own 2030 Climate Strategy, approving this tender will offer us the certainty that we’ll be able to create this major aspect of the council’s Granton Waterfront regeneration. Housing will be critical to achieving our net-zero goals by 2030, and Western Villages will serve as a model for future new construction throughout the city. As part of the larger regeneration project, one of Europe’s largest coastal city parks will be built, allowing residents and visitors to reconnect with the city’s waterfront by providing more leisure and outdoor experiences, civic spaces, and sustainable housing.”
