The Umzimvubu Water Project which has been under development since 1962 is finally getting underway with the construction of phase one that will be carried out in Ntabelanga in Tsolo, Eastern Cape.

The Laleni Dam, which will be erected along the Titsa River, will in addition to providing domestic water, help with hydroelectric power generation, and irrigation programs. The resumption of the implementation of the project is a tremendous relief for rural populations that still rely on rivers for water. Unsafe water sources are used by around 24% of the province’s households. Some locals, such as Nomzi Ngxiti, must walk significant distances to obtain water from the river. Farmers reportedly want all the three dams erected at the same time while traditional leaders who are equally delighted with the resumption of the project, want the Ntabelanga and Laleni Dams built simultaneously. However, Bandile Gqwetha, the Chairperson of the African Farmers’ Association of South Africa, explains that this may impede the construction progress. The government on the other hand asked the citizens to be patient. In addition to the construction of the dam, the first phase of the project also includes the construction of an access road to the site office in Siqhungqwini Village as well as repairing river crossings.
