The construction of over 330 housing units, as part of the Vlakkeland Housing Project in Drakenstein, Cape Town, South Africa, has been completed according to the Western Cape Department of Human Settlements (WCDoHS), which is responsible for developing sustainable integrated human settlements in the Western Cape. Commenting on this milestone, Tertuis Alfred Simmers, the Western Cape Provincial Minister of Human Settlements said that he was pleased with the progress made at this development, particularly since it is a site that was severely impacted by the Covid pandemic, and the various lockdown levels. “This is an important development that will assist in changing people who are in dire need of a housing opportunity. In terms of job creation, this project has already employed more than 180 people, and it is envisaged to employ at least 260 more between the 2022/24 financial years,” explained minister Simmers.
