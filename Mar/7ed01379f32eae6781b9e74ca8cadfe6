In a media briefing, Salah A Bukhatir, Chairman of the Sharjah-based Bukhatir Group, and Afif Bejaoui, CEO of the group’s Tunisian affiliate, recently announced the United Arab Emirates-based company plans to revive the Tunis Sports City megaproject. Sports Cities International, a unit of the Bukhatir Group, had initially begun work on the project in July 2009, with a completion date of 2024. Due to the global financial crisis in 2008, political and economic instability in Tunisia, and 2011 Tunisia’s Arab Spring protests, the Tunis Sports City mega project had been stalled for 15 years. According to the Bukhatir group, the Tunis Sports City will cover 250 hectares on the northern shores of the Lac de Tunis. It will include a stadium, four sports academies, a 9-hole golf course, in partnership with the PGA, six hotels, a 20-hectare central park with pedestrian walkways, a residential compound of villas and terraced buildings, a mall, a business zone, and a three-kilometer-long corniche with entertainment and water sports facilities.
