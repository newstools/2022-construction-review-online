Rosendin Renewable Energy Group (REG) and Tokyo Gas America are working together to reach the full capacity of their 500 MW (AC) Aktina Solar Project, which broke ground about two years ago in Texas. The Aktina Solar Project, which is the largest of its kind in the state involving the installation of 1.4 million solar modules across a 4,000 acres piece of land located approximately 87 miles southwest of Houston, at El Campo, is being carried out in phases, the first of which began generating power in mid-2021. The power production of the Aktina Solar Project is boosted by mounting bifacial solar panels over Genius TrackerTM single-axis solar tracker systems, from GameChange Solar. The solar plant, also uses preassembled GameChange Solar SpeedClampsTM technology, which makes the installation process faster.

Once completed, the facility will produce enough electricity to power up to 100,000 homes each year. The electricity produced at the Aktina Solar Project will be distributed to the 345kV Hillje Substation, owned by CenterPoint Energy, and sold to the ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) wholesale market. Rosendin Renewable Energy Group (REG) and Tokyo Gas America have engaged Jinko Solar, a Chinese company to be in charge of the manufacture and supply of the photovoltaic modules for the plant. Sukut Construction was subcontracted by Rosendin Electric Group to handle the installation of mechanical equipment while Origis Services was contracted by Tokyo Gas America to handle the operation and maintenance services of the solar project. A total of 500 employees and union contractors were recruited from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to build the solar farm.
