Offshore construction on the 88 MW Hywind Tampen floating wind farm is slated to begin with the shipment and installation of suction anchors at the location 140 kilometers off the Norwegian coast, according to DOF Subsea. The Skandi Skansen subsea AHTS vessel and the DOF Subsea team are currently prepared to begin installation work prior to the tow of the finalized wind turbines to the site. Hywind Tampen will be made up of 11 Siemens Gamesa 8 MW wind turbines mounted on concrete SPAR-type floating foundations in sea depths ranging from 260 to 300 meters. It will be the first floating offshore wind facility to offer renewable energy to oil and gas plants when it is completed by the end of 2022.

Aker Solutions (previously Kvrner) is the business in charge of supplying the turbine foundations, while JDR Cable System, Subsea 7, and Wood group are among the project’s primary suppliers and service providers, in addition to Siemens Gamesa. JDR Cable System is in charge of supplying the project’s electric cables from its facilities in Hartlepool, UK. Subsea 7 AS will install the cables and connect them to the Snorre and Gullfaks platforms, while Wood Group will be in charge of making changes to the two oil and gas platforms. Equinor is developing and operating the slightly over US$ 504M wind farm on behalf of the partnerships that include Equinor Energy AS, Petoro AS, and OMV (Norge) AS for the Gulflaks license, and Equinor Energy AS, Petoro AS, Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS, Wintershall Dea Norge AS, and Vr Energi AS for the Snorre license.
