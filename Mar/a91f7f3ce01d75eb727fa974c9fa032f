Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Force and Crowned Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan gifted the total sum of well over 14 acres; upon which the BAPS Hindu Temple In UAE will be built. During a meeting in the Presidential Palace, representatives from BAPS met with Sheikh Mohammed, and a memorandum of understanding was signed between the UAE and India. It was signed in the presence of over 250 local leaders as well as the entire royal family. The site of the project is located at Abu Mureikhah, which is near Al Rahba off the Dubai-Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Highway. For the construction of the BAPS Hindu Temple In UAE, tonnes of pink sandstone will be shipped from the northern part of India, Rajasthan to Abu Dhabi. This shipped arrangement was chosen because the durable stones from the northern part of the country can withstand the scorching summer temperatures that reach 50 °C (122 °F).
