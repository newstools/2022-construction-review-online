Los Lirios mixed-use apartments in Los Angeles, a project by East Los Angeles Community Corporation (ELACC), a non-profit community development corporation based in Boyle Heights that advocates for economic and social justice in Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles by building grassroots leadership, developing affordable housing and neighborhood assets, and providing access to economic development opportunities for low and moderate-income families, has broken ground.

Soto Street, immediately south of Soto Station, near a Metro Stop in Los Angeles’ Boyle Heights neighborhood. Designed by the Pasadena California-based Architecture firm, Gonzalez Goodale, Los Lirios Mixed-Use Apartments will be five-storeys tall with a total of 64 apartments, which are a mix of studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments, according to designs authorized by the City of Los Angeles back in 2020. 63 out of the 64 apartments will be affordable, designated particularly for homeless people and households earning 30 to 50% of the region’s median income. The apartments will be sitting above 2,443 square feet of ground-floor retail space, and 50 basement parking slots. On-site, there will also be 66 bicycle parking places, comprising 54 long-term and 12 short-term spaces. Vehicles would enter the underground garage and loading area by a single entry along the existing alley next to the Project Site on the west side. Noteworthy, the modern low-rise structure will include over 8,000 square feet of open space, which will be achieved through elements including a central courtyard, a roof terrace, and an exercise area. The City of Los Angeles previously accepted an environmental analysis that predicted construction would take just over a year.
