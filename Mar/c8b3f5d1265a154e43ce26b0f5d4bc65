Whiteman Vehicle Maintenance Facility in Missouri, a state in the Midwestern region of the United States is set for construction following a groundbreaking event held recently at the project’s site. The facility, which will be built by the US Air Force (USAF) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on the Whiteman Air Force Base, will span across 58,000 sqft, which is approximately 20,000 sqft larger than the previous facility. USACE is also working towards meeting the mission requirements for the new Vehicle Maintenance Facility, by collaborating with members of the 509th Civil Engineer Squadron (CES), as well as other airmen and civilians who will make use of the facility to build projects. New Operations and Maintenance Facility completed in Bellevue, Washington According to Ben Schreiber, a resident engineer of the USACE, a lot of useful feedback for the designs was gotten from the people who are expected to use the new Whiteman Vehicle Maintenance Facility. Schreiber mentioned that these people knew the areas they needed space and where the areas they didn’t, which was vital information required for building a facility that would remain operational for over 25 years. The project scope according to Derrick Timm, the project manager of the CES, besides the construction of the new Whiteman Vehicle Maintenance Facility in Missouri, also entails the disposal of about 10 old facilities along with a dilapidating parking lot area on the Northside of the base. Timm further explained that reducing the number of old structures at the base would save the money needed for maintenance and help consolidate smaller buildings. The works are expected to be rounded up by September 2023.
