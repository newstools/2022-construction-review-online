If the price of a 60% AMI unit exceeds the rental rate, the unit will be converted to the appropriate level at that time. Present residents of the Park-Vue in Alexandria will be able to keep their current rent without an increase if their current rent is greater than 60% of the region’s median income. A pet park, resident lounge, exercise center, and waterscape are among the current community attractions in addition to 275 grade-level parking spots and 14 laundry facilities. The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is three miles to the east of the town, while The Pentagon is three miles to the north. Half-mile south lies the Birchmere music venue, as well as various more entertainment, retail, and food alternatives. The Amazon Housing Equity Fund provided a low-interest acquisition loan of US$ 51.4M. In the coming future, AHDC will engage with Amazon and other credit partners to refinance the property which will have a 99-year affordability commitment in place. Covenant Capital Group was represented by Cushman & Wakefield and the neighborhood will be managed by S.L. Nusbaum.
