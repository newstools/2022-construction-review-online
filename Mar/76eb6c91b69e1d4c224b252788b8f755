Out of the US$ 317M needed to completely implement the Kiffa drinking water supply system project, 600 kilometers southeast of Nouakchott, the Mauritanian government recently received initial funding of US$ 100M. The loan deal was recently signed by Al-Marshad, the CEO of the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), Ousmane Mamadou Kane, the Minister of Economic Affairs of Mauritania, and Mohamed El-Hassan Ould Boukhris, the Minister of Water and Sanitation of Mauritania. The SFD investment in the Kiffa drinking water supply system project was in response to the Mauritanian government’s call for money mobilization in November 2021, as part of the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River’s proposed water sharing mechanism.
