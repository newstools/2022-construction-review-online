A 47-unit Permanent Supportive Housing project is now set to begin construction at Los Angeles Southside Bethel Baptist Church Site following the allocation of US$ 8M investment for the development of the project. The US$ 8M investment was allocated by SDS Capital Group (Formerly Strategic Development Solutions), which will be providing  95% of the project’s total capital through its private-equity impact fund that is aimed at providing housing for individuals experiencing homelessness. The remaining costs will be covered by its co-investment partner and project developer, RMG Housing, a developer of permanent supportive housing for homeless people and those with mental and physical disabilities. This project involves the redevelopment of the Los Angeles Southside Bethel Baptist Church, located at 10400 S. San Pedro Street, into a five-story apartment, consisting of 47 one-bedroom residential units.

Pastor Fred Howard of the Los Angeles Southside Bethel Baptist Church supported the move and mentioned that the church was proud to be a partner in such an innovative supportive housing project, which enables them to make a real and positive change in the community. Construction is scheduled to commence in March and be completed by November 2023.
