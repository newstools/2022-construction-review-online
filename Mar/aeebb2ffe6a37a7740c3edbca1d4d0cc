The construction of a new 3MW solar farm on about 26 acres of the 65-acre site on Racefield Drive in James City, Virginia, has been approved unanimously by the Board of Supervisors. Hexagon Energy LLC, located in Charlottesville, submitted the bid. The farm, according to Development Manager Brendan Grajewski, is in keeping with the county’s 2045 comprehensive plan since it would protect rural lands. According to Grajewski, the solar panels will be on the land for at least 35 years with minimal to no environmental impact. Grajewski stated that the farm’s site designs respect community needs, such as buffers or non-invasive plants. To alleviate traffic issues, the business intends to approach the site through a separate highway rather than Racefield Drive, which is not suitable for construction equipment.

At its February meeting, the planning panel voted 4-1 to recommend approval of the project but not the rezoning, arguing that it would create a precedent for future landowners requesting similar requests. With the board’s final permission to rezone the land and authorize the whole project, the corporation may start working on the site with the county’s planning department. Grajewski believes that construction will begin in 2023, subject to state and federal approvals. The Norge Solar Farm was authorized by the county in 2018, while the Rochambeau Solar Farm was approved in 2019. “I understand the AFD committee’s and the planning commission’s reservations since we do have certain restrictions in place.” As you can see, it was a split choice, but I see this as a win, win, win situation. This is a conservation easement with a term of 35 years. “We’re not getting it sliced into residential lots,” stated Board Supervisor Jim Icenhour.
