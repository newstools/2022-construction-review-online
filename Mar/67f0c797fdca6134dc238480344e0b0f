Green Street Real Estate Ventures LLC and Midas Enterprises have announced plans to construct a US$ 100M Green Street and Midas Hotel in Missouri at the intersection of Forsyth Boulevard and North Central Avenue in Clayton, a western St. Louis suburb in Missouri. The 25-story skyscraper, which will be located immediately east of the St. Louis County Police Department building, will comprise 73 condo apartments and 180 hotel rooms. A rooftop terrace and bar, a 300-person private event area, a street-level restaurant, street-level retail space, and a five-story parking structure will be among the facilities. The architect will be HDA, a Green Street business. The development team anticipates breaking ground this autumn, with a 24-month building timeline following. According to David Robert, co-founder and CEO of Maryland Heights-based Midas, the Green Street and Midas hotel, which would be among the first new hotels built in Clayton in 30 years, is billed as a premium boutique brand under the Hilton banner.

Green Street and Midas executives said the project is one of several in the works that might transform Clayton’s dynamic from a buttoned-down daytime business atmosphere to one where young people will want to reside and hang out. Among them is a trio of developers, including St. Louis-based Koplar Properties, who have proposed an AC Hotel at the former Clayton police headquarters on South Central Avenue, and Balke Brown Transwestern, which would build 237 apartments at Bemiston and Maryland avenues.
