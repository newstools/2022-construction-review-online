Meta, Facebook’s parent company, is set to build a new US$ 800M Data Center in Kansas Citys Golden Plains Technology Park which is a 5.5-million-square-foot land development in the Northland that was proposed to the city by Black & Veatch affiliate Diode Ventures. Meta would use some of the space in the vast technological park, which would probably eventually include additional enterprises. The construction of the technology park will allegedly feature 16 buildings and 760 acres near the southwest corner of Northwest 128th Street and US Highway 169. Meta would require 375 acres and three structures. Meta picked Kansas City as the site of the planned data center due to its central position, lower risk of natural catastrophes, competitive energy pricing, and renewable energy sources. Last year, the Kansas City Council approved up to US$ 8.2bn in tax breaks for the data centre site. Plans had been filed at the time, including a business named Velvet Tech Services, LLC, which turned out to be a shell company for Meta. According to Gov. Mike Parson, the project would create 100 new permanent jobs and 1,300 temporary ones during peak construction. The governor stated that the site will be powered entirely by renewable energy and will contribute more renewable energy to the region’s local grid. “Meta is thrilled to be relocating to Kansas City. It stands out because it has so much to offer, including easy access to infrastructure and fibre, a large pool of expertise for both building and operations, and, most importantly, wonderful community partners. Darcy Nothnagle, Meta’s director of community and economic development, said in a statement, “Meta is dedicated to being a good neighbor and investing in the long-term viability of the region for years to come.”
