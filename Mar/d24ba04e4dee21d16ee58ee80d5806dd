Investec Property plans to develop Africa’s largest rooftop solar power plant at Cornubia Mall in Durban, South Africa, as part of its ambition to integrate renewable, low carbon emission technologies throughout its assets. Terra Firma Solutions, a leading turnkey energy engineering solution provider based in sub-Saharan Africa, will be in charge of the construction of the facility, which will take approximately 5 months to complete. The firm will install a total of 9 505 solar panels utilizing 34 workers, 20 of which are Duran residents while the rest are skilled experts from Terra Firma Solutions. Upon completion, the rooftop solar power plant at Cornubia Mall will have a DC capacity of 5 254 kWp (5.25 MWp) and an AC capacity of 4 290 kW (4.29 MW) which is roughly 10.5% larger than the current largest rooftop system that has a DC capacity of 4 755 kWp (4.75 MWp).
