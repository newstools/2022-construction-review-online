BBA Pumps is proud to introduce the first plug-in hybrid wellpoint dewatering pump. A PT piston pump is assembled with both a diesel engine and an electric motor. In the super silent canopy, you will find a PTclassic piston pump designed on the know-how from more than 30 years of experience in wellpoint dewatering. The pump is assembled with both a diesel engine and an electric motor. The Plug-in hybrid is incredibly simple to work with. All you have to do is stop the diesel engine with the ignition key and then connect a 32A socket to the plug of the electric motor… …Now you can start up the electric motor immediately with the star-delta switch without having to change drive belts.
