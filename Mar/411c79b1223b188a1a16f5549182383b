The ongoing construction of a 30-room mid-market Akagera Safari Camp at Akagera National Park in Rwanda is expected to be complete in July and to welcome guests in August this year according to Martin Chege, Reservations Manager of 3B Group of Hotels. 3B Group of Hotels is a leading safari lodges and camps hospitality group in the East African country and the developer of the Akagera Safari Camp. Recently the hospitality group signed with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, a US$ 3.7M credit arrangement to help fund the development of the 30-room mid-market safari camp in Akagera National Park. The project is projected to provide over 90 permanent employment and additional temporary positions throughout the building period. Upon completion, the project would also expand the 3B Group of Hotels network in the nation. Currently, the group manages three mid-market resorts in Rwanda, which are Mountain Gorilla View Lodge in Volcanoes National Park in northern Rwanda, Kivu Lodge on the beaches of Lake Kivu in Western Rwanda, and Flame Tree Village hotel in Kigali. According to Paul Muvunyi, Chairman of the 3B Group of Hotels, they are expanding their activities to the eastern area to provide the visitors with a comprehensive experience of Rwanda’s tourist products and diversity of tourism places. Most notably, the expansion will increase the average duration of stay at 3B Group of Hotels. According to Jumoke Jagun-Dokunmu, IFC Regional Director for Eastern Africa, tourism is a significant engine of economic growth in Rwanda and other areas of Africa. Still, the industry needs further support in the aftermath of COVID-19’s negative impacts on commerce and travel. Jagun-Dokunmu said that the cooperation would create employment and enhance Rwanda’s tourist industry as it recovers from the epidemic, and IFC invests in tourism because of its good developmental impact on a variety of local companies.
