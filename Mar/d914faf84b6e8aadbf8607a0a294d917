Grofit Construction Company, a veteran enterprise with over 45 years of experience in the construction business has announced plans to build a 130-Room Hotel & 30 Residential Apartments in Sarona, Tel Aviv. Designed by Feigin Architects, a leading architectural design studio with 55 years of experience within the global hospitality sector, the “new” 14-floor hotel building is planned to replace the existing four-floor building on the corner of Menachem Begin Road and Yosef Karo Street near the Kalkathat that Grofit purchased for over US$ 29M. The plans for the construction of the 130-Room Hotel & 30 Residential Apartments in Sarona were passed through to the Tel Aviv-Yafo Planning and Building Committee in April 2021, and only got approved just recently.

The company will then go ahead and demolish the old building. The 130-Room Hotel & 30 Residential Apartments in Sarona will not be the first or the only one of its kind in the area. There is another 45-floor hotel with a total of 800 planned rooms, that is being developed nearby, on the same street. The hotel will also include a sky lobby on the 38th floor, a spacious convention center, a spa with two pools and restaurants alongside stores. However, unlike the Sarona Hotel that is being built by Grofit, the neighboring hotel will not include residential apartments.
