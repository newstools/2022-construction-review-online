The Etihad Rail is a 1,200 km network that is being developed across the United Arab Emirates, from the border of Saudi Arabia to the border of Oman. The project aims to link the centers of industry, trade, and population of the UAE. The megaproject is projected to grow from running heavy goods services to facilitating the transportation of millions of passengers all within and between the major cities by 2030. The center of operations is currently at the depot in Mirfa, and it services all movements between the track and the trains.

The project is also said to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions by well over 80% The Etihad Rail Train Project was first established in 2009 while phase one of the project officially became operational in 2016. Since then two tracks that span 264 kilometers have been operating. The trains have been transporting granulated sulfur from the gasfield in Habshan and Shah that are then exported to Ruwais. On a daily, the trains run across the country with the capacity to carry up to 22,000 tonners of sulfur. It is said that each train can be able to pull up to 2 wagons. When completed the railway network will be able to link the main centers of industry and population across the UAE region. It will also end up playing an essential role in the planned railway network across the entire Gulf region. This will result in a connection happening between the seven emirates of the country to the neighboring five GCC states. Phase two of the Etihad Rail Train Project will manage to link Saudia Arabia and the UAE from Ghuerifat to Fujairah through Mussafah located in Khalifa Port and Jebel Ali Port.
