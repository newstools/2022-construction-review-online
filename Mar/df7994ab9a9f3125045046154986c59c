Warehouses all over the globe play a crucial role in the success of various industries while also providing countless jobs for the population. A pallet rack system is typically in place in most of these warehouses. Although it’s a popular system, its safety aspect is oftentimes overlooked by entrepreneurs. If left unchecked, it can cause significant damage and injuries in the long run. It’s said that employees in warehouses are exposed to various hazards, including incidental falls and other racking-related injuries. Consider taking a multi-faceted approach to maintaining and monitoring the rack system to keep your storage facility safe from hazards. Regardless of the business you’re running, you should consider the safety of your warehouse operations, especially with pallet racking systems. Make it a top priority for your warehouse to adhere to the necessary safety precautions to avoid any problems with your pallet rack system. Whether you’re planning to build a brand-new warehouse or renovate an existing one, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind to uphold a safe pallet rack system. Below are a number of tips you should know: When you have a pallet rack system in your warehouse, expect various reasons for any problems. However, an untrained forklift operator is a common cause. In a warehouse, operating any machinery can be difficult because it usually involves turning and the risk of bumping or hitting nearby racks. If you want to reduce the likelihood of damage to your pallet rack system or injury to your employees, all forklift operators must undergo proper training. Your forklift operators must be able to stack the loads in the proper order. When positioning the pallets on the storage racks, the forklift operators should carefully position and load them straight onto the system. Placing the pallets on the support beams can result in capacity issues. As a result, your warehouse operations will run smoothly and safely. Aside from forklift training, all employees should undergo training on basic measures for reporting damage to the rack system.   Regular maintenance and inspections are essential if you want to ensure the safety of your warehouse’s pallet rack system. Following regular inspections is an effective way to ensure the safety netting, racks, or mezzanine floors are in good condition. Other critical components should be in good working order and placed correctly. Walkthroughs should be done at least once a week, if not more frequently, and you should carry out comprehensive inspections of the racks or mezzanine floors once a month. Inspections are necessary on older equipment that may show signs of rust or decline as well. Any damage during the inspection would require unloading the rack until a professional performs the necessary repairs. Although preventative measures will cost you more money and time, they’re essential for the safety of your warehouse’s pallet rack system. The layout of your warehouse facility should be able to store all of your stocks, depending on what you have currently in store. Make sure the aisles in your warehouse are spacious enough to allow safe navigation of both employees and machinery. Although narrowing aisles to accommodate a larger stockpile may seem appealing, it can be dangerous. Tight aisles make it difficult to move around without hitting or bumping into the pallets and racks with machinery and equipment. Proper operation of forklifts can be challenging due to the bars in front. If you want your staff to maneuver safely, make sure the aisles, overhead beams, and supports are marked, preferably with brightly colored paint or tape in key areas. Lighting is also an important element in the aisles of your warehouse, especially inside drive-in racks. To avoid any untoward accidents, invest in good-quality lighting and visible height markers. Further, place them in conspicuous areas in your warehouse. Once a product or merchandise falls off a stored pallet, it can put your employees at risk of serious injury. An option worth considering to prevent this is to reinforce the pallets. Depending on the products or merchandise you have in your warehouse, consider utilizing a pallet stop, backstop beam, wire mesh screen, or netting. In an overcrowded warehouse, you’re likely to see loads of merchandise on the storage racks to maximize the available space. It’s something you should avoid, despite most people finding it tempting. Overloaded pallet racks can be dangerous, especially if the pallet racks can no longer support the weight. When pallet racks are overloaded, it can cause problems with the system’s stability and structure. Provide specific labels on each storage rack that display the load limits as a safety precaution. The proper maintenance of a pallet rack system should be one of your top priorities for warehouse efficiency and safety. Although keeping a pallet rack system safe can be challenging, these important considerations will ensure a safe pallet rack system in your warehouse while improving operations.
