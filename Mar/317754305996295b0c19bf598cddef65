The construction of Chief Seattle Club ?ál?al, an 80-unit low-income apartment complex developed by Chief Seattle Club, a Native-led housing and human services agency, has been completed. The complex, the name of which is derived from the Lushootseed word for “home” (roughly pronounced “allall”), is designed by Jones & Jones Architects, a 40+ year collaboration of architects, landscape architects, and planners grounded in a commitment to place, community identity, and nature. It is approximately 85 feet tall and 53,000 square feet in size. The exterior is adorned with Native-themed brickwork, including a piece of the façade depicting boats, while the inside walls are adorned with artwork made by Native artisans. Inside the Chief Seattle Club ?ál?al Apartment premises will be health care and social service facilities. The Seattle Indian Health Board will administer the clinic, which will include six exam rooms, a pharmacy, and a traditional healing area where patients may obtain medical, dental, pharmaceutical, mental health, and traditional medicine services. There will also be a cafe in the building that will sell cuisine from Native companies and roasters, and rooms for additional services, case management employees, job training facilities, and education.
