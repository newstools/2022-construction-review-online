The 156-acre piece of land occupied by the Ghana International Trade Fair Center and other tenants is set to be converted into a new modern mixed-use smart, green, and sustainable commercial estate. This new destination will also house a technological hub that will serve as a commercial, research, and high-end manufacturing center to support the government’s industrialization drive into the twenty-first century, as well as a Made-in-Ghana trade hub that will help small and medium-scale enterprises. The implementation of the project for the conversion of the Ghana International Trade Fair Center into a new modern mixed-use hub is spearheaded by the Ghana Trade Fair Company, which was founded to aid Ghana’s post-independence trade and industrialization efforts and positioned to promote and exhibit Ghana’s products in order to attract investors.
