Please enable JavaScript Plans for the project to renovate the historic General Hospital building in Boyle Heights by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors are making headways. The project will include repurposing the mostly empty facility to create hundreds of affordable housing units. The board passed a resolution from Supervisor Hilda Solis requesting that several county agencies go through with their plans for building structural renovations and identify approximately $195 million in county resources to support the initiative. The 19-story, 1.2 million square foot structure was one of the most capable medical facilities in the nation when it debuted in 1934. With its art deco style and elaborate ceiling decorations, it is also an architectural treasure.

The idea of adding hundreds of affordable housing units while extending the Wellness Center’s activities to offer more comprehensive services for individuals who would reside in the facility and other members of the community was one of the study’s conclusions. The proposal, which was overwhelmingly passed by the Board of Supervisors, requests that the county CEO submit a strategy, financing alternatives, and potential timeframe for the work within four months. Additionally, it asks for reallocating millions of dollars from different accounts, including $10 million from the county’s Care First, Jails Last program, and $50 million from state monies contained in this year’s California budget, to use for the project. In response to Kuehl’s concerns about money and how it would affect the county’s overall budget, board chairwoman Holly Mitchell said she shared those concerns. She still voted in favor of the motion while pointing out that the current goal is to explore new financing sources.
