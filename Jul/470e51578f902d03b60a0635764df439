Nkawkaw Sports Stadium construction is anticipated to cost US$ 3.35M. This is according to  Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr. Mustapha Ussif. The latter made the revelation while speaking to the Parliament. He explained that the first phase will cost US$ 1.7M. The second phase on the other hand the minister said will cost US$ 1.6M. Moreover, Ussif revealed that the Middle Belt Development Authority will fund the project. The former Youth and Sports Minister, Mr. Isaac Asiamah, broke ground for Nkawkaw Sports Stadium on Friday, September 18, 2020. Work on the stadium started but had to be halted. This was because of some architectural aspects that needed revision. The aspects in question are the sitting capacity, athletic oval, and dressing rooms. According to Mr. Ussif, the architectural assessment is currently complete.

Also, it will feature a multi-purpose court for more than 16 different sports, a tennis court, a gymnasium, an IAAF standard track, hostels, and a restaurant. The contractor is therefore expected to be on-site as soon as possible to start work. In reiterating the government’s position on athletic facilities, Mr. Ussif claimed that Astro Turf pitches were a substitute for standard football pitches in several Ghanaian communities. In order to ensure that each constituency in the country had access to modern pitches, he claimed that the Ministry had established the “One Constituency, One Astro Turf Policy,” and Nkawkaw Constituency would undoubtedly be taken into consideration. He claimed that the Ministry was actively pursuing the objective of encouraging decent sporting events. This is in pursuit of recruiting new talent in the country for international competition.
