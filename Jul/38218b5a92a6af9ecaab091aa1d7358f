Construction has been announced for a brand-new 350-unit luxury apartment complex at 1441 Peachtree street in Atlanta. The project was announced by Atlantic Residential and FIDES Development. The project is a result of the cooperation of the two businesses and the involvement of Mitsui Fudosan America and Capital City Real Estate. The 350-unit luxury apartment at 1441 Peachtree homes will include floor designs with studios, one, two, and three bedrooms. Many of the residences will have balconies or sizable patios.

A private dining room and a dazzling pool with a sundeck will also be provided. Furthermore, there will be an amazing rooftop bar and club with beautiful views of Ansley Park. Additionally, the lobby will have two restaurant areas with floor-to-ceiling glass and high ceilings. Residents of the new 350-unit luxury apartment at 1441 Peachtree will have easy access to several iconic attractions. These include “the Most Cultured Square Mile in the Southeast.” Other attractions include the Alliance Theatre, the High Museum of Art, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. “The High Museum, designed by Richard Meier to the south, represents an icon of high art.  It represents the artists without whom art would not be possible. This has served as the inspiration for the architectural character of the building,” said project architect Andres Rubio, Principal at Niles Bolton Associates in Atlanta. “The developing composition is a conversation between the two ideas and generates a rhythmic façade of stacked grids, tones, solids, planes, and voids.”
