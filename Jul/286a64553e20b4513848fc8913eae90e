Please enable JavaScript Plans are underway for the construction of up to 350 all-electric homes in Birmingham. Set to be developed by St Modwen, the project will be located at the former Longbridge MG Rover location. Electricity will be distributed and monitored across a network of homes, powered by a special “smart grid,” to ensure that this first phase of homes is completely gas-free. As St Modwen continues to pioneer sustainable new ways to build and power homes, the innovation is thought to be the first to be utilized by a significant developer. Together with SNRG, experts in next-generation energy infrastructure, the smart grid design is being created.

The homes are made to produce more energy than they consume using cutting-edge building methods and renewable technologies like solar panels and heat pumps, which could cut a family’s overall energy costs by 76 percent when compared to a typical new-build house. As carbon-reducing technology becomes the norm, elements of this trial will be implemented in the new electric homes and subsequently across all new developments by St Modwen. CEO of St. Modwen Sarwjit Sambhi stated: “Every organization needs to take steps to deliver more sustainable goods and services, but at St. Modwen, we have made strides by introducing carbon-negative homes and developments powered by smart grids. We’re demonstrating that greener homes can be built on a large scale, which not only benefits the environment but also enables us to satisfy customer demand. The local authority is currently in charge of detailed planning for the first phase of the scheme, and work is scheduled to begin this autumn.
