A water intake that will feed a drinking water plant with a daily capacity of 55,000 m3 will be constructed as part of the project. Furthermore, elevated and ground-level tanks with a combined capacity of about 16,500 m3 will be included in the future facilities. In addition, 10,000 household meters will be installed as part of the project to improve the water supply in Sunyani, along with the construction of two booster stations, 93 km of transmission pipelines, buildings to house laboratories and chemical storage, and a power line to serve the entire region. GWCL intends to construct water kiosks in several areas of the Bono area. A feasibility study for 133 million has already been completed. With delivery of the future facility beginning in 2025, earthworks are anticipated to begin towards the end of July 2022. The Ghanaian central government, which made other investments in 2018, will provide the funding. In response to this intervention, according to the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA), more than 3,400 boreholes and more than 400 wells have been constructed. GWCL currently supplies residents in Sunyani town through groundwater pumping stations. By storing rainwater, the utility hopes to ease pressure on the water table.
