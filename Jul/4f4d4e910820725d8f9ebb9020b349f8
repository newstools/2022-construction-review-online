Several top firms have also relocated there, according to Kyle Jeffers of Acore Capital, making it an excellent investment market. “We had a lot of confidence in issuing this construction loan because of that, outstanding sponsorship, and a building that was 50% pre-leased,” said Jeffers. “The funding from Acore Capital helps us move the Ryan Tower project ahead. Although the pandemic altered how people worked, [Dallas-Fort Worth] continues to be a popular location for businesses. Thus seeking office space, and leasing activity has increased dramatically,” said Paul Rowsey.
