Please enable JavaScript Greeter Abuja Water Project which had previously been thought of as a legacy project is now gravely endangered in terms of execution and delivery. This was revealed by the project’s contractor, China Geo-Engineering Company (CGC). According to CGC, the federal government has been unable to release its 20% counterpart funding for the execution of the US$ 470M project as planned. This comes approximately five years after the inception of the project, which was intended to increase water supply throughout the federal capital territory’s numerous districts.

The Federal Government of Nigeria, however, according to Xiang has not yet released any money from the 20% counterpart fund. “This project is intended to increase water supply throughout the several districts of the federal capital area. However, the federal government of Nigeria’s refusal to fulfill its own commitment is holding up its full implementation. As the project’s managers, we appeal to the Hon Minister and Distinguished Senators in expediting the delivery of the 20% counterpart money”, concluded the Greeter Abuja water project manager.
