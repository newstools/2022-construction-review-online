The plans are being put in place by the French nuclear company Orano.  The aim of the French multinational is to minimize its carbon footprint. In addition, it also seeks to reduce the energy expenditures of its facilities in this southern African nation. Noteworthy, Orano has already signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with InnoSun. This is reportedly in a bid to expedite the implementation of the project. As a result of the agreement, the plant will be built, financed, and run by InnoSun. The solar power facility will be located approximately 35 kilometers north of Swakopmund. Work will begin on the 5MWp Erongo desalination plant solar park site in the second half of 2022. The facility is scheduled for commissioning towards the end of 2023. The clean electricity produced will be sold to Orano over 10 years period.

In addition, the group’s policy also seeks to increase the share of low-carbon electricity at its operating sites worldwide. The 5MWp Erongo desalination plant solar park is therefore expected to cut the company’s yearly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30%. This is the equivalent of 9,722 metric tons of CO2 emissions. The reverse osmosis facility, constructed between 2008 and 2010, has a 20 million m3 annual capacity. However, this capacity may be raised to 45 million m3 annually. The facility’s owner is Orano Resources Namibia, a division of Orano (formerly Areva). The former has handed management of the facility over to Nafasi Water, a business with its headquarters in Germiston, South Africa.
