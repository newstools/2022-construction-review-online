Please enable JavaScript Lagos roads maintenance is set to continue throughout this rainy season according to the Lagos State Public Works Corporation (LSPWC). LSPWC General Manager Lateef Somide gave the assurance during a tour of various repair locations in the state. The sites include Itire-Lawanson Road in Surulere, Orishigun Street in Ketu, and Agbowa-Itoikin Road in Ikorodu. Somide noted that recent heavy rains in Lagos had hindered the corporation’s response to problematic sections of roads. Consequently, the LSPWC GM said this has led to an increase in potholes appearing on roadways, particularly those that need to be completely rebuilt. However, he affirmed that the agency would continue to be present on the roadways during the administration to carry out the Lagos roads maintenance. According to Somide, the hot asphalt premix employed in the Lagos roads maintenance is not ideal for the wet season. As a result, LSPWC personnel will be seen restoring roads even in the rain using interlocking paving stones.

Cold-mixed asphalt and interlocking paving stones, on the other hand, were used to fix some roads depending on the terrain. All this Somide said is in a bid to minimize the challenges posed by bad roads. It will consequently result in the free movement of persons and goods during the wet season. Over 20 roads have been maintained using hot asphalt premix. 25 more have been temporarily relieved using boulders. Moreover, roughly eight more have been repaired using interlocking paving stones according to Somide. Some of the roads where bad sections were fixed are Ikorodu Road, inward Ketu; and Lekki-Epe Expressway by Ogidan Bus Stop. Oke Afa-Ejigbo Road by NNPC Bus Stop; and Ijegun Road by Abaranje Street, among others were also worked on.
