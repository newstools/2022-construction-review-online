Please enable JavaScript Local council members have given their approval for Nottingham Forest’s Ground expansion project. The club intends to renovate the Main Stand in order to increase the City Ground’s capacity to 35,000. The Peter Taylor Stand will be rebuilt to add 5,000 seats, along with public space and parking, according to the approved plans. The construction of a 13-story apartment building next to the stadium, which will help pay for the project, has also been proposed by the council.  Nottingham Forest’s Ground expansion project has been in the works for almost three years as of the first announcement of the plans in 2019. The Peter Taylor Stand’s demolition and reconstruction were supposed to start work the following year, but it was postponed because of delays in the planning process. It appears that the issue has been solved at this point. The Rushcliffe Borough Council met to talk about the club’s plans. The council has since confirmed that permission has been granted. In a club statement in response to the choice, Forest expressed their happiness.

They stated, “We believe that the site’s development is essential to preserving the club’s status in the Premier League and all of the rewards that this status brings to the local community and economy.” “The decision now permits the Club to hold in-depth consultations with its partners and advisers regarding the manner and timing of the development. These discussions will start as soon as it is practical, and the club is still committed to giving its wonderful fans a stadium they can be proud of in the modern era.”
