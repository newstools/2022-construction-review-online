This is according to the information provided by the chairman of the Parliamentary Roads Committee. He said that construction on the Boankra Inland Port Project should be completed by August. The chairman added that the project would be carried out by Joshob Construction Limited. He claimed that the Boankra Inland Port project, which has been in the works for generations, would be constructed in August. The developers, he added on his Facebook page, who are a combination of Korean and Ghanaian citizens, have received a $330 million concession from the government to work on the port. He said that the actual work was slated to begin in October 2020. The project had to stall because of COVID-19, delaying the task. He said that the project was a part of a strategic transportation network being established. This was to provide import and export services to the country’s central and northern parts. The Boankra Inland Port project was started in 2003 by the Kuffour Administration. The project had all its required feasibility studies completed in the same year. However, more than 15 years after the project’s inception, actual construction work has yet to begin to bring the project to light. The project was resumed two years ago after the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, officially cut the sod. The representative stated that the government was still committed to seeing that the project was delivered.
