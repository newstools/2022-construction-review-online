The government of Kenya has thus far allocated 30 acres of land near KUTRRH for the development of the project. It has also according to President Kenyatta made a $5 million commitment to operationalizing the hub to assist operations. Furthermore, the president stated that the government had also given WHO rent-free office space at the KUTRRH. This will accommodate the initial staff component of up to 150 officers required to begin planning for the hub’s development.
