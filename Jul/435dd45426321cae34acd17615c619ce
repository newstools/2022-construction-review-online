This was revealed by the Dubai Municipality. The facility will feature five treatment lines. However, for initial operations, the facility will work with two of the treatment lines. They will generate a total of 80 Mwh of renewable energy. Furthermore, the treatment lines will process well about 2000 tons of solid waste within a day. The very first stage of the facility will include the receiving of waste. Thereafter, the resulting steam pressure will be used to operate the steam turbine. Which, will then produce enough rotational energy to move the attached electric generator. The facility also aims to establish a sustainable and eco-friendly system within the emirate for waste management.
