Saeed bin Hamdam al Muqaimi also added that the company had completed an array of several road construction projects. Especially in the mountains of the Tiwi area. Thus, they aim to deliver their very best for this current project. The project mainly involves the construction of an 8-kilometer-long road that will make a connection between two governorates. The first governorate is North Sharqiyah while the second is South Sharqiyah governorate. The road project will therefore cut down the 200-kilometer distance between the two governorates. Most especially, the time it takes to reach Wadi Bani Khalid from the capital of Muscat. The completion of the project is expected to bring fortunes to the nearby villages as it will boost tourism, by reducing the travel time between Tiwi and Wadi Bani Khalid. Moreover, the project will contribute to the country achieving the objectives set out in the Oman Vision 2040. The (Islamic Legal Guardian) Wali of Wadi Bani Khali commented on the project. Saif bin Muhammad al Ghaithi remarked that the road will help activate movement in the area. Furthermore, Ghaithi said the road will contribute to increased tourism between the governorates of the South Sharqiyah as well as the North Sharqiyah.
