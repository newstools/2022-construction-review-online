Plans have been submitted for the construction of the London One East Point tower on the Isle of Dogs. The 52-storey 170m tall residential skyscraper was designed by architect Make, for GAW Capital. It will have 52,000 square meters of space, including a lower podium and two basement levels. A mix of affordable and market homes are planned for levels up to the 24th floor while the upper levels will be for market sale. According to Make partner Simon Robins, the London One East Point tower will be located at the site of 4 & 5 Harbour Exchange Square. It will displace an unutilised office complex with a 52-story stepped, orthogonal building. The building will provide a total of 457 new homes, as well as 119 affordable homes. When completed, the London One East Point tower will be the latest massive tower block in Tower Hamlets. It will be in close proximity to Amory Tower. The latter is a 53-story residential building completed by Make in 2020. The London One East Point tower will also be near the 225 Marsh Wall. This is a 48-story residential tower currently under construction by Make.
