The 35km Pamanga-Dakka road construction was recently kick-started by Taraba State Governor Darius Ishaku. This took place in the Bali local government area of the state. The Governor explained that the project was part of the current administration’s dedication to ensure infrastructural revolution, especially in urban and rural areas. The project will be carried out by Geld (Great Engineering Leads Development) Construction. GELD provides a comprehensive range of construction and related services. These include construction of roads, bridges, dams, project management, infrastructure solutions, and power installations. The company in addition finances infrastructure through various models of Public-Private Partnership (PPP), and other financing models. The Pamanga-Dakka road project is scheduled to be completed and commissioned in December of 2022. Mr. Azzam Fabi, Project Chief Engineer, GELD Construction Company, expressed optimism that the Pamanga-Dakka road would be delivered on time. He said that his company had already completed 21 kilometers of the 35-kilometer road. The Pamanga-Dakka road project is reportedly crucial to governor Ishakus administration. Ishaku explained that the road will generate agricultural economic interest once fully constructed. He said it would particularly boost local agricultural production as well as improve revenue generation in the state. As a result, the standards of living for the area’s residents will be elevated.
