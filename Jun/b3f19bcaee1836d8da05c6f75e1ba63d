The construction of a new soybean processing mill in southeast Kansas has been announced by Barlett a Savage Co. The US$375 million plant will be an essential source of feedstock for the production of sustainable fuels. Food items and animal feeds will also be produced. The factory will be located in Montgomery County. It will be owned and operated by Bartlett. The mill will be able to crush 45 million bushels of soybeans per year. It will produce soybean meals and refined soybean oil. The facility is expected to start up in early 2024. The Montgomery County Action Council, in collaboration with the Kansas Department of Commerce’s Office of Rural Prosperity, conducted a groundbreaking ceremony and luncheon to honour the commencement of this key economic development initiative for the region. The plant’s location in Montgomery County, near the town of Cherryvale, provides easy access to highways 160, 166, 169 and 400. South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad, owned and operated by WATCO, will provide rail services for the facility. It will connect the plant to a network of Class 1 carriers. Ground preparation work is currently being performed by Crossland Construction Company for the processing plant, grain elevator and loop track system. “We’re really happy to begin work on our soybean crushing plant in Montgomery County. The plant will be a driving force in Southeast Kansas. This will expand markets for local soybean growers and agribusinesses. We appreciate the continued support of state, federal, and local officials. We look forward to playing an important role in the food, animal feed, and renewable fuel industries. By procuring up to 65 million gallons of feedstock for sustainable transportation fuels yearly, we will minimize greenhouse gas emissions by more than 400,000 tons per year,” stated Bob Knief, president of Bartlett.
