The dismantling works for the Netherlands Pavilion at the EXPO Dubai have begun. According to Witteveen+Bos, the pavilion is one of the very few that are being dismantled through the use of sustainable methods. The consultancy also noted that all the materials that were used in the construction of the Pavillion were, reusable, recyclable, and biodegradable and the same materials will be utilized for future projects in the United Arab Emirates. The Netherlands Pavilion at EXPO Dubai was built by a consortium of four companies including Witteveen+Bos that catered to the indoor climate system, the building physics, the structural design as well as the sustainable aspects of the Pavillion.

Built with sustainability in mind, the Pavillion was designed as a biotope and built as a circular climate system that brings together Dutch Solutions that unite energy, food, and water. Witteveen+Bos officially confirmed that the steel tubes and sheet piles that were used for the pavilion’s construction will be returned to a Dutch Company, Meever. The steel tubes and sheet piles that are 18 meters long, will then be (re)used for new and upcoming construction projects. Even in the foundations, the Netherlands Pavilion was constructed without concrete, and when the dismantling of the Pavillion is completed the plot is planned to be left as it was found originally in 2018, as the empty and natural piece of (desert) land that it is.
