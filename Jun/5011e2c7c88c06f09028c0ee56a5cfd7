The 1.1GW Gulf of Suez and Gabal el Zeit wind project in Egypt has been awarded. The project was awarded to Acwa Power and Hassan Allam Holding at a cost of approximately  US$ 1.5bn. ACWA Power is a Saudi Arabian developer, investor, co-owner and operator of a portfolio of power generation and desalinated water production plants. Hassan Allam Holding on the other hand is Egypt’s leading privately owned engineering, construction and infrastructure company operating on a stand-alone basis. The two firms will work together during the project’s development phase to finish the site studies. They will also collaborate to secure financing for the project. The facility will make use of the state of the art wind turbines with blade heights reaching 220 meters. The blades will help achieve the best and most efficient use of the designated land plots. When completed, the project is expected to mitigate the impact of 2.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Moreover, it is expected to provide electricity to about 1,080,000 households in the North African country.

This is reportedly in an effort to decrease the impact of carbon emissions produced by conventional sources of energy. Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy stated that the project also aims to diversify the country’s sources of energy. This would consequently help Egypt in leveraging its rich natural resources, more so when it comes to renewable energy.
