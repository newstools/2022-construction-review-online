The development of a 258,801-square-foot industrial facility, which is a part of the first 2 million-square-foot of the Evergreen Logistics Park in South Carolina has begun following a groundbreaking ceremony carried out by Hunt Midwest, a real estate development company with decades of expertise in industrial, self-storage, residential, multifamily, and senior living communities. The Evergreen Logistics Park in South Carolina is located in Anderson County’s industrial corridor and is intended to provide users with industrial spaces ranging between 75,000 to 1 million square feet upon completion. The development offers multiple build-to-suit configuration formats and a location with immediate access to I-85, connecting tenants to several major Southeastern population centres, as well as a major FedEx terminal and booming manufacturing base, which are next to the park.
