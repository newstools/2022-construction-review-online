The Tuli-Manyange Dam project in Gwanda, a district located in Matabeleland South Province of Zimbabwe is reportedly well on course. The preliminary work, which includes the construction of two saddle dams, is well underway, with the first dam already 80% complete. The preliminary work is expected to be finished by July of this year.

After the excavation is finished, concrete will be put on the main dam’s foundation, and the foundation will be treated to plug fractures. Following that, a wall will be built. Drilling, blasting, and transporting of rocks are also underway in preparation for the fabrication of concrete stones needed for dam building. Zinwa is in charge of the project, and China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) is in charge of the civil works. Contractors are also anticipated to asphalt the 7km dusty section going from the Gwanda-Ntepe road to the dam site. Treasury provided $43 million last year to hasten the project, which is scheduled to be completed in December of next year.  Mrs Marjorie Munyonga, corporate communications and marketing manager for the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa), stated that everything was in place to complete the project within the stipulated time. The Tuli-Manyange Dam is another achievement of the Second Republic in terms of helping rural residents’ livelihoods, as it will provide raw water for agriculture. It is expected that after the Tuli-Manyange Dam is completed, at least 2 000 hectares will be irrigated. The dam would also service the irrigation projects of Vela, Guyu Business Centre, Ntalale Business Centre, Chelesa Business Centre, Sizhubane Barracks, Manama Mission and Business Centre, Sebasa, and Mankonkoni.
