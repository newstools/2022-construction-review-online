The Al-Arous integrated-community project in Jeddah is under the wings of Saudi Arabia’s national real estate developer ROSHN, which is a fully owned company by the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Announced during the Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal match in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Cup Professional League, the project is the second community developed by ROSHN and is a part of a larger strategy for the development of vibrant and modern neighbourhoods within the nine cities as well as the four regions located within Saudi Arabia. The project is also another significant step toward Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 ambitions. The Vision 2030 initiative aims to improve and raise the quality of life for all of Saudi Arabia’s citizens as well as boost homeownership levels across the country.
