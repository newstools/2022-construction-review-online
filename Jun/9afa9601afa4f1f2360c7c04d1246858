The mini-grids and PV solar systems are estimated to generate about 111,361 MWh of electricity in total yearly, reducing the CO2 emissions by 0.7795 million tons per year and creating up to 2,865 jobs during construction, with women and the youth acquiring 30 per cent of the jobs. The solar net-metered installations cost $44.89 million, whereas the mini-grids cost $40.29 million. The $27.39 million investment will be made by the African Development Fund, while the Ghanaian government will contribute $16 million and Switzerland will contribute $14 million. Furthermore, the African Development Bank Group leveraged $28.49 million in concessional financing. The Swiss government will provide funding to support Ghana in building up its existing net-metering initiative and constructing up to 12,000 roof-mounted net-metered photovoltaic systems for small and medium enterprises and homes. Dominique Paravicini, Switzerland’s Ambassador, stated that they were delighted to have achieved yet another milestone in Switzerland’s partnership with Ghana. He added that by working together, they will be able to provide sustainable and affordable electricity to over 6,000 small and medium enterprises, over 5,000 homes, as well as 1,100 public buildings.
