Fuyao, China’s largest floating wind turbine has been towed to its destination in waters south of Guangdong Province by China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). The Fuyao floater, designed by CSSC subsidiary Haizhuang Wind Power, is outfitted with a 6.2 MW typhoon-resistant wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 152 metres. According to CSSC, the floating platform has a length of 72 metres, a draught of 33 metres, and a width of 80 metres, with the tower standing 78 metres tall and the centre height of the hub standing 96 metres.

The site was chosen because of the water depths, which range between 50 and 70 metres, as well as the complex seabed topography, strong typhoons that occur frequently in summer, and strong ocean currents – all of which are conditions for which the floater is said to be designed, particularly in terms of water depth, which is said to be no less than 50 metres for Fuayo. Guangzhou Salvage installed China’s first floating wind turbine off the coast of Yangjiang City in Guangdong Province on July 2021. The floating wind turbine, developed independently by MingYang Smart Energy, was installed for demonstration purposes at China Three Gorges’ (CTG) 400 MW Yangxi Shapa III offshore wind farm, where it was to be tested. Guangzhou Salvage was in charge of the offshore installation work, which included first installing the suction anchors, mooring wires, and anchor chain pre-deployment in Yangxi, followed by the load-out and towing of the floating foundation from Wison yard (Zhoushan) to Maoming.
