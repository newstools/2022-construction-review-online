Huyton Village Centre regeneration project in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, Merseyside, England, has taken a step forward after Knowsley Council appointed Genr8 Kajima Regeneration Limited, a joint venture between two companies in charge of major redevelopment schemes in Rochdale and Stoke, as the new development partner for the implementation of the project. According to a report prepared for a cabinet meeting, Genr8 Kajima was chosen after a “comprehensive” procurement process. Reportedly the company has “substantial resources and specialist skills” and will be able to offer the project with “significant financial backing and support.” The redevelopment of Huyton Village Centre has been a crucial part of Knowsley Council‘s vision since 2017 when councillors initially committed to a “masterplan” for the area. Knowsley’s assembly passed a more detailed ten-year decision to move its vision for Huyton village forward in December 2020. Parts of the town centre have already been renovated, including a shop front renewal project and the demolition of some council-owned buildings. A commercial district in the town centre is planned, complete with a hotel, offices, residential, and co-working spaces centring on a new ‘village green.’ Also Read: 22-Storey Building to be Constructed as part of Salford Central Regeneration Project in England According to the plans, Derby Road would become an “anchor” and “signature street,” serving as a “focal point” for the town centre. A multi-story parking garage is being demolished to make way for a mixed-use leisure development along the stretch. The proposals also include an improved station gateway and a nearby health and well-being centre. Knowsley Council hopes that the plans will create up to 1,700 jobs and boost the local economy by £50.8 million per year. Knowsley Council announced in July that it would begin a procurement process to find a development partner to help move the plans forward.
