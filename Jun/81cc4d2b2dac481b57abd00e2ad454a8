A 515 kilowatt-peak (kWp) capacity solar plant at Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) headquarters in Dubai that was launched in H2 of 2019 as part of plans to boost business in the MEA region, has been commissioned by Daikin Middle East and Africa, a global leader in developing and manufacturing advanced, high-quality air conditioning, heating, ventilation and refrigeration products (HVAC-R) and solutions for residential, commercial and industrial applications. Developed through a solar lease with Yellow Door Energy, the leading sustainable energy partner for businesses, serving commercial and industrial customers in the Middle East and South Asia, the plant is projected to generate over 800,000-kilowatt-hours of clean electricity through a total of 1,000 solar panels during its first year of operation. The installation of the said solar panels has met more than 80% of JAFZA Headquarters’ energy consumption needs. Speaking on the project, the Chief Commercial Officer to Yellow Door Energy, Rory McCarthy, congratulated Daikin on their milestone towards Net Zero emissions adding that his company was honoured to support their Environmental Vision for 2050 and that they look forward to maintaining and operating the solar plant for many years to come. He further expressed that Yellow Door Energy is humbled to contribute to the United Arab Emirate’s Clean Energy Initiative and Strategy.
