Therefore, there has to be significant collaboration with the private sector,” said Komolafe, who was speaking on behalf of Mr. Jide Adeola, the Executive Commissioner, Corporate Services and Administration. Following a groundbreaking event that took place recently, the La Bella Casa Estate, should be fully constructed and available for occupation in 18 months. The project mainly aims to provide 400 commission staff with affordable housing in the nation’s capital. Dr. Tochukwu Nnamoko on the other hand said that the La Bella Casa Estate project was a step in the right direction. The actual outcomes and benefits, according to the CEO of Ti’Bilon Construction and Facility Management Limited, will become evident in a few years to come. The La Bella Casa Estate, Nnamoko said, will have a variety of buildings. Theses include five-bedroom luxury duplexes with boys’ quarters, a gym and swimming pool, a private movie room, and a sauna. “Shortage of housing is the biggest problem facing the country’s economy. Our main objective is to close the gap by offering our clients luxurious but fairly priced housing,” concluded Nnamoko.
