Every state has different requirements, so you’ll need to do some research to find out what you need in your area. Once you have the required licenses and permits, you’ll be able to start your business with confidence, knowing that you’re operating legally.

As your business grows, you can then start investing in new equipment. Be sure to do your research and purchase the right equipment for your needs, otherwise you may end up wasting money on something that you won’t use very often, or that doesn’t work well for your specific projects.
