The construction of a state-of-the-art Marvelous Nakamba Sports Complex in Mahatshula, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, has begun. The project is developed and will be administered by the Marvelous Nakamba Foundation (MNF), which was founded approximately two years ago by Marvelous Nakamba, an Aston Villa midfielder and Zimbabwean international residing in England, to help poor children and youth through educational programs, sports, projects, life experiences, and talents. The project began with the implementation of the first phase under which the land on which the structure will be situated will be cleared to create space for the actual construction works to begin. Earthmoving machinery, according to Nakamba, has already been mobilized to guarantee comprehensive and proper land clearance and preparation.
