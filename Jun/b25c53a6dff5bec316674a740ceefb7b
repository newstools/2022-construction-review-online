The construction of the latest building in the burgeoning neighbourhood of Harbor Point in Baltimore has begun. The structure, known as Allied Harbor Point (previously Parcel 4 at Harbor Point), will include shops, parking, and the third and largest residential building in the 27-acre neighbourhood on Baltimore’s waterfront. It’s one of three properties being built as part of Harbor Point’s Phase 3 development, alongside Point Park and the new T. Rowe Price corporate buildings, which commenced work in March. Beatty Development Group and Armada Hoffler are developing the project together, as they did with the T. Rowe buildings, with Armada Hoffler serving as general contractor. Allied Harbor Point was designed by BHC Architects. According to Jonathan Flesher, vice president of development for Beatty Development Group, the 10,000 square feet of retail, known as Allied Row, will eventually connect to a hotel, but the design and construction of the hotel are six to nine months behind plans for the rest of Allied Harbor Point. The hotel’s brand has yet to be announced, however, Flesher stated that the developers expect to make an announcement within the month. Beatty Design will oversee the interior design of both the hotel and the residential complex. Allied Row will strive to give facilities to apartment dwellers while also attracting visitors to the area.

We’re attempting to strike a balance between things that residents and tenants require, such as a dry cleaner and a medicine store, and things that attract people, such as restaurants,” said Jonathan Flesher. “We’re thinking, at least in this building, of some smaller stores, smaller enterprises, maybe locations for artists to sell their crafts.”
