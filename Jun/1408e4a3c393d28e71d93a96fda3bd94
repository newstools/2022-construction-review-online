The implementation of the project for the construction of a total of 32 TVET Centers in Ghana is set to begin soon according to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, the Vice President of the West African country. The project involves the construction of one TVET Center of Excellence, sixteen Category A Centers, and fifteen Centers in the B Category. The Centre of Excellence will be established in Abrankese (Ashanti region); the six ‘Category A’ facilities will be established in Boako (Western North), Kenyasi (Ahafo), Dambai (Oti), Patuda (Bono East), Salaga (Savannah), and Guabuliga (North East); while two Category B facilities will be established in Akyem Awisa (Eastern) and Tolibri (Upper West).

When completed the 32 TVET Centers in Ghana will facilitate access to technical and vocational education and offer opportunities for practising artisans to learn and improve skills in order to fulfil the country’s development needs, notably those of industry. It is said that the main aim of the project is to improve youth employment, particularly in remote areas; expand equitable access in public TVET institutions targeting females and the rural poor; improve the relevance and quality of TVET delivery; and build technical and management capacity of CTVET as well as other skills training centres. In addition, the project is expected to provide youth with entrepreneurship skills, use a cooperative strategy for skills training to enable youth to create their own jobs, retrain current workers with skill gaps, and instil productivity and credibility in master craftsmen.
