Plans for the proposed 500 MW Ba Ria-Vung Tau offshore wind farm project in Vietnam are moving forward. Recently a Vietnamese construction and infrastructure group signed a joint development agreement for the project. The group includes Corio Generation and Fecon. The former is a specialist offshore wind business, dedicated to harnessing offshore wind energy worldwide while the latter is the leader in land clearing equipment and mulcher attachments. Our operator-driven designs are engineered for maximum durability. The farm will be located in Ba Ria, Vung Tau province, Vietnam, 23-35 kilometres from the coast. As a result, it could become one of the first large-scale offshore wind schemes to be constructed in Vietnam. According to the Green Investment Group, when completed, the 500 MW Ba Ria-Vung Tau fixed-bottom offshore wind farm project in Vietnam could generate approximately 1,250 GWh of clean electricity. Other than power generation, the 500 MW Ba Ria-Vung Tau offshore wind farm will help the country avoid over 600,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year. Speaking on the project, Jonathan Cole, CEO of Corio Generation explained that Vietnam has the potential to become a Southeast Asian powerhouse in offshore wind, providing clean, affordable electricity. Furthermore, the CEO said the facility will also bring about jobs and economic opportunities for local communities” Also Read: 45MW solar power project in Vietnam completed. “For many years, the Hanoi team has been researching opportunities throughout the country. We are considering a number of potential schemes and collaborations to demonstrate Corio’s commitment to offshore wind in Vietnam. Our strategy is to partner with the most reputable and capable local businesses. As a result, we are pleased to enter into this joint development agreement for the Ba Ria-Vung Tau offshore wind farm project with FECON.
