Recently, the Egyptian government stated that it intends to construct 14 new seawater desalination plants in the upcoming period, mainly in coastal and border cities, with the aim of expanding its desalination projects. According to the government, the project will increase the country’s total desalination plant capacity to 1.4 million cubic meters per day. This emerges as Ethiopia seeks to implement the dam’s reservoir’s third filling phase, despite stalled negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly led a Cabinet meeting attended by a number of ministers and officials to discuss plans to increase the number of seawater desalination plants in the country. He authorized the formation of a technical committee to accept offers from companies interested in implementing the 14 new seawater desalination plants in Egypt and to negotiate the best charges possible. Madbouly tasked government agencies with securing the necessary lands for desalination projects and also lands for industrial projects that will provide the essential inputs for desalination plants, like manufacturing equipment for desalination.

He went on to say that the plan aims to meet the demands of future natural population growth while also ensuring water needs for urban development goals. Egypt currently operates 82 desalination plants with a combined capacity of 917,000 cubic meters each day.
