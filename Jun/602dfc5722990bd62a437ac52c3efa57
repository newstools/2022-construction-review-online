Raumfachwerk, the winning design for Zurich Airport’s new Dock A, that was proposed by Bjarke Ingels’ Copenhagen/New York-based architecture firm BIG, and the US-based HOK, will be largely built of wood. Buro Happold Engineering and Pirmin Jung, a Swiss engineering firm specializing in timber construction were also a part of the winning team. The design aims to set new standards for sustainable terminal buildings. The winning project, ‘Raumfachwerk,’ is scheduled to begin construction in 2030. The investment in the new Dock A, which includes a new tower and dock base, is estimated to be around CHF700 million (£585 million).

The Raumfachwerk project was chosen from ten submissions by the eleven-member jury, chaired by Basel-based architect Harry Gugger. “The ‘Raumfachwerk’ project was the most impressive, particularly in terms of sustainability, operations, and economic factors, but also in terms of urban planning and architecture,” stated Andreas Schmid, chairman of Flughafen Zürich’s board of directors. On the passenger levels, the new Dock A will be constructed primarily of sustainable wood. Photovoltaics will cover the entire surface of the new dock’s roof and dock base, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the dock’s annual electricity demand. As a result, the new structure will make a significant contribution to Flughafen Zürich AG’s CO2 reduction strategy. The current Dock A will remain operational during the construction of the new Dock A, as it serves approximately one-third of all passengers. Operations will be transferred to the new dock, which will be built to the north of the current Dock A. The current Dock A will be demolished.
