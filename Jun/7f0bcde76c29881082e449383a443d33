A project for the construction of proposed new senior supportive housing in Cudahy, a city in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States, is set to move forward after the board of supervisors of the Los Angeles County, approved a US$ 10M grant to the developer, Prima Development. This cash will come from the Fourth Supervisorial District’s Community Programs budget, and it will be combined with a separate $800,000 allocation to pay administrative expenditures at the L.A. County Development Authority. Incorporating inexpensive and permanent supportive housing for seniors, the 140-unit apartment complex will be developed on vacant 1.34-acre land at 4610 Santa Ana Street. Cudahy officials authorized the proposal in 2020, and it is envisioned as a five-story structure with a mix of one- and two-bedroom homes, 20,000 square feet of commercial uses at street level, and semi-subterranean parking for 190 automobiles. “The proposed development is intended to be a significant mixed-use development that offers a one-stop housing and wellness solution for low-income and homeless seniors, as well as an array of on-site health services and economic development opportunities accessible to the surrounding community, such as job creation and education and training programs.

Hahn’s motion describes the initiative as a method to improve health and wellness results in Cudahy, which is the state’s second-most densely populated city but also has one of the lowest median family income levels. The Prima Development project might be a portent of things to come for the working-class community since other County-owned lands at the intersection of Santa Ana Street and Atlantic Avenue are also slated for redevelopment.
