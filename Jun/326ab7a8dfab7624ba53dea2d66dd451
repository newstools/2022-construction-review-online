Parc 1 tower is a mixed-use development in Seoul, South Korea, designed by London-based practise Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. It is defined by red-painted steel columns, trusses, and cables reminiscent of the high-tech architecture movement. The complex spans 630,000 square metres. It includes retail space, two office towers, and a 326-room hotel, as well as parking and public areas. RSHP collaborated with co-architects Samoo Architects and Engineers and Siaplan Architects and Planners, as well as Leonard Design Architects, Arup, and DongYang Structural Engineers Co. Ltd on the project.

The complex integrates public transportation, retail, commercial, and hotel accommodation to form a new urban hub. The creation of a series of structures that create a hierarchy of public spaces was central to this concept. It also included tree-lined boulevards and plazas for public events. The office towers are located on the northwest side of the site, while the hotel is located on the southeast. The lower volume of the shopping centre in the centre is surrounded by planted public boulevards. The building’s steel structures have been expressed externally. This alludes to the late Richard Rogers’ role as a founding figure of Britain’s high-tech movement. As a result, the interiors are largely column-free. The bright red paint used to complete this steelwork, together with the shopping centre’s pitched roof segments, was inspired by traditional Korean architecture. The interiors of the shopping centre were designed by Leonard Design Architects. They feature a full-height void beneath three large, pitched skylights. The sweeping, stacked shop floors are all lined with balconies that overlook the void. They are topped by open, greener areas where visitors can dwell and relax.
