The Federal Government’s ambition to construct a second runway for the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA) in Abuja, has gained momentum. This is after it acquired the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) for 12,000 hectares of land in the capital. As per a recent statement released by Mrs Faithful Hope-Ivbaze, the Ag. General Manager, Corporate Communications, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), the C of O was handed over to Sen. Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Aviation, in Abuja. According to the statement, Engr. Mohammed Kabiru Shehu, Director, Planning, Research and Statistics, Ministry of Aviation, who was represented by Sirika at the event, said that some land would be used for the construction of the second runway. The Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Nigeria Limited (CCECC) was awarded the contract to construct the second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at the start of the year.
