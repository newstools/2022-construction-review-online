Plans have been announced for the construction of a slightly over US$ 95.5M Smith+Nephew medical facility in East Yorkshire. The plans were announced by Smith & Nephew plc, a British multinational medical equipment manufacturing company headquartered in Watford, England. Also known as Smith+Nephew, the global conglomerate, which was founded in the city over 150 years ago, plans to build the “state of the art” research, development, and manufacturing centre for its enhanced wound management business at the 200-acre business park. The new amenity, subject to planning permission, will be situated at Melton West Business Park, eight miles from the prominent site by the Daltry Street flyover, where an average of 800 people are employed. It will take the place of its current location, which has been in use for more than a century.

Sales of £8 billion are expected in the first decade of operations, with public funds supporting the development. Melton West Business Park is described as the closest suitable available site to the current Hull facility, as well as one of Yorkshire and the Humber’s premier investment and job creation locations. The new location is scheduled to open in 2024. The company collaborated with Hull City Council but was unable to “find a properly sized and deliverable site within the city.” It has agreed to collaborate with officers and other stakeholders on future facility options. The Smith & Nephew medical facility will be the latest major addition to the growing Melton site, which already has over one million square feet of completed warehouse, distribution, manufacturing, and office space.
