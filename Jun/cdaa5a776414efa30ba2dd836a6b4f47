Nembe-Brass road project at Nembe, a Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, Nigeria, has been flagged off. Mr Babatunde Fashola the West African country’s Minister of Works and Housing led the occasion. The Nembe-Brass road is one of the three state senatorial roads linking both riverine councils. The project for its construction has been on the drawing board of the country’s successive administrations since the 1940s, in the colonial era. Governor Douye Diri‘s administration revived the road project, as it had promised in the campaigns. It awarded the first phase of 21km and 10 bridges to Setraco Nigeria Limited. Setraco Nigeria is a leading engineering company with over 35 years of working experience in delivering value-added civil and infrastructural projects in Nigeria. According to the Director of Highways (South-South), Mr Godwin Eke, the Nembe-Brass road project is expected to benefit from the government’s current tax credit scheme. The scheme is supported by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC). When completed, the road will open up the Brass Island, which possesses major national economic assets like the ongoing Brass Liquified Natural Gas and the Brass Fertilizer, Agip oil export terminal, and petrochemical projects. The road, according to Mr Moses Teibowei, Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, will also attract huge investments to Brass Island. Furthermore, it will transform the area into the state’s economic and tourism hub. Mr Ziad Muonanse, Setraco Nigeria Limited Deputy Managing Director, also expressed gratitude to the governor for having faith in his company to construct the state’s major roads. He also gave assurance that the Nembe-Brass road project will be delivered on time, and with high standards by his company.
