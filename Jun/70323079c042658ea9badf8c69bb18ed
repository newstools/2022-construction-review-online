The construction of a women & children green smart hospital in Abuja, Nigeria, has officially begun following a groundbreaking ceremony carried out by the Naval Officers Wives Association (NOWA), a forum formulated to provide endearing service to humanity, as well as a platform for solving social and societal problems. Coming up on 2.1 hectares of land in Galadimawa at a cost of US$ 36M, the 200-bed hospital is scheduled to launch in the second quarter of 2023. The hospital, which is the largest since NOWA’s inception and direct intervention in support of the operations of the Navy is the first of its kind in Nigeria, according to NOWA’s National President, Mrs Nana Aisha Gambo. Mrs Gambo explained that they were all aware of the terrible state of health of a reasonable percentage of Nigerian women and children. She added that since they were involved, it is understandable that women and children are losing their lives on a daily basis owing to insufficient medical care, especially in mother-and-child hospitals.
