Plans have been unveiled for an integrated large-scale development project in Sharjah, one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The project was unveiled by the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority. Also known as Shurooq, the authority is responsible for the development of Sharjah into an investment, tourism, and business destination. The integrated large-scale development project in Sharjah will be situated on a total area of 38,000 square meters located right opposite the Khorfakkan port. The project will include restaurants, pools, and a ballroom for special occasions. It will also feature 75 deluxe units. The proposed rooms will offer five double rooms, eight luxury suites, and 62 single rooms. All units will come with a stunning view of the Arabian Sea and offers unparalleled luxury for visitors to the tranquil eastern enclave. The acting CEO of Shurooq, Ahmed Obaid Al Qaseer revealed interesting details about the project. He said that the integrated large-scale development project will feature a waterpark. The waterpark is said to be the first within the eastern region of the emirate. It will cater to the ever-growing demand for leisure and tourism experiences on the East Coast. Ahmed pointed out that the project will also feature well over 200 residential units. These units, he added, would be serviced by restaurants, as well as retail stores. Additionally, a host of other outlets on the ground level would be available. The project follows the ongoing development of the nature-inspired, Al Jabal resort in Khorfakkan. It is aimed at completion by 2024.
