Hailed as an economic boost for the region, the project to convert the A47 section between Norwich and Acle into a dual carriageway has been approved. With the government’s approval, just over 1.6 miles of road between Blofield and North Burlingham will be dualled. It is a huge step forward for the region, triggering the beginning of £300 million in work on the A47. The project was first revealed back in 2014. On June 22, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced that he would grant development consent for the work. The project could cost up to £90 million. It is the first of three major projects planned for the A47. Decisions on two other projects will be made by the autumn.

The projects are also set to dual some of the remaining single carriageway sections of one of the county’s most important roads. Martin Wilby, cabinet member for highways, infrastructure, and transport at Norfolk County Council and chair of the A47 Alliance commented on the government’s decision. He said, “This project will make a great change to the economy of Norfolk and the eastern region. It will ensure more safety, congestion, connectivity, and journey times along the route. We will continue to press the government for additional improvements in order to alleviate the issues faced on the A47.” According to National Highways, the Yarmouth Road junction will also be improved in terms of safety. This will be done by closing the right turn and adding a dedicated lane to connect to the A47.
