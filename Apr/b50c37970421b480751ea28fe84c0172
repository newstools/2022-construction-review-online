Following a recent site inspection carried out by the steering committee of the Jiji Mulembwe CHs Project (PHJIMU) as part of the work monitoring, the construction work on Burundi’s Jiji and Mulembwe Hydropower Plants Development Project has reportedly achieved 48% completion. The projects, which in addition to the construction of the two hydropower facilities that are approximately 3.75 kilometers apart include the construction of infrastructure necessary for electric power transmission and distribution, are being carried out in Bururi Province in the country’s southeast region.

The project is divided into three parts: Component A consists of Hydropower Plants and Related Infrastructure, Component B of project technical assistance, and Component C of institutional development support for the electrical industry. This hydropower projects, the total installed capacity of which is estimated at 48 MW-more than quadruple the national installed power-producing capacity (now 39 MW), aims to increase Burundi’s electric power output. They will have a favorable influence on the long-term viability of the energy industry in particular and the economy of Burundi as a whole and also facilitate the provision of energy to the project’s local villages. In addition, they will help reduce the country’s energy deficit while also fostering green and equitable growth.

By supplying cost-effective electricity to homes and companies and promoting human well-being, responsible hydropower development can make a significant contribution to eradicating poverty and increasing shared prosperity on the African continent.
