The company will also install a total of 263 kilometres of pipes and carry out electromechanical works in the different facilities. Exim Bank of India will fund the implementation of the entire project through a loan worth between 1,000 and 2,500 million rupees ($13 million to $33 million). The realization of the water infrastructure projects in Tanzania will move the east African country closer to the government’s goal to attain 93% access to clean drinking water for its citizens, 4 million of which according to the worldwide group Water.org do not have access to a safe drinking water source, by 2025.
