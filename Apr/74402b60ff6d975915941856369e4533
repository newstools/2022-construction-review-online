JPMorgan has announced plans to construct 270 Park Avenue, a 60-story skyscraper towering 1,388 feet in Midtown Manhattan, New York, as the banking firm’s new global headquarters. 270 Park Avenue replaces a former structure built in the late 1950s for around 3,500 employees. Set to be completed by the end of 2025, the office tower project will generate over 8,000 construction jobs during the phase of construction and, when completed, house up to 14,000 people in its 2.5 million square feet of adaptable and collaborative space. The asset will also provide 2.5 times the amount of outdoor space on the ground floor of Park and Madison avenues, as well as broader walkways and a huge public plaza. A dining hall, a health and wellness center, community areas, HVAC filtration systems, and a conference center will also be included in the office tower. The 270 Park Avenue will be powered entirely by renewable energy produced from a hydroelectric facility in New York State, resulting in net-zero carbon emissions. Intelligent building systems that employ sensors, AI, and machine learning systems to adapt to energy demands; sophisticated water storage and reuse systems to cut water consumption by more than 40%; and automated solar shades coupled to HVAC systems for increased energy efficiency will be included in the asset. JPMorgan is also recycling, reusing, or upcycling 97 percent of the building materials from the current property’s destruction.
