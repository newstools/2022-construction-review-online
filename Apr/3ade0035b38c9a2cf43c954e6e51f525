Additional locations, such as Naples or Fort Lauderdale, might be studied but are not currently planned. The Vertical Medical City Foundation will fund geriatric research in chronic and acute conditions, prescriptive nutrition, assistive technologies and applications, and provide financial assistance to its residents to alleviate the overwhelming burden that so many families face today and in times like these. Support for the Vertical Medical City Foundation will provide valuable resources for the continuous development and improvement of this new model being deployed in Vertical Medical City, that of a connected continuum of life and care for those over 60, and will serve as a model for others in the geriatric medical and long term care spaces to follow suit as these locations begin to deploy the best and healthiest environments for our seniors to live their best most emancipated lives. Recent events related to the Coronavirus Pandemic only serve to highlight the importance of the Vertical Medical City mission and deployment, as well as the hard work of the Ponte Health team and its partners, with current market conditions highlighting the significance and value of the outcomes being created.
