A new apartment complex, Waterfront Station II, that is set to provide affordable housing alternatives to a typically pricy sector of the city is currently under construction at 1000 Fourth Street SW, just one block from the Waterfront Metro station and three blocks from the Wharf, which has a wealth of restaurants, music venues, stores, and entertainment. Designed by Torti Gallas, the project’s residential component contains 449 units, 136 of which (30%) will be classified as affordable housing. Many of the units will have angular 150-to-200-square-foot balconies with glass fronts and views of the Washington Monument, the United States Capitol, and the Anacostia and Potomac rivers.

Solar panels will be installed at the Waterfront Station II apartment complex to improve energy efficiency.
