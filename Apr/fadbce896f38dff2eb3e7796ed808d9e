The construction of a new multi-purpose Stornoway Deep Water Terminal in Scotland is set to commence in the coming weeks after authorities awarded McLaughlin & Harvey,  a family-run building and civil engineering business that has been operating for over 165 years across the UK and Ireland, the contract to carry out the works which will initially comprise piling, blasting of 750,000 tonnes of rock, and dredging. The terminal will serve a variety of industries, including energy and transportation, and its architecture will allow it to be converted for a variety of future uses. In addition to accommodating on and offshore wind farm vessels and supporting other energy-sector activity, its main berth will be large enough to accommodate the largest cruise ships, boosting the islands’ tourism business.

Over the last four years, the Stornoway Port Authority has worked closely with the Scottish government, the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), and Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar (CnES) to promote the project. John Swinney, Deputy First Minister stated, “The construction of the Stornoway Deep Water Terminal will be a game-changer for the local economy as well as Scotland’s ambitions to enhance its renewables and cruise sectors. The Scottish government has long supported this initiative, which would create jobs and provide numerous economic advantages to the Hebrides. The terminal is an important component of the Islands Growth Deal, as it will enable cruise traffic and the expansion of the offshore renewables supply chain following the ScotWind offshore wind lease round, as well as providing infrastructure for a variety of other prospective industries. As chair of the Stornoway Deep Water Terminal Advisory Board, I am glad to see construction beginning and this essential project moving forward.”
