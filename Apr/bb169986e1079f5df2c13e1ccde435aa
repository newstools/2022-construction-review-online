Malawi’s ethanol distiller, Ethanol Company (EthCo), has announced plans for the development of a new EthCo plant that would transform trash & waste from its facilities into useful fertilizer & energy. The announcement was particularly made by Lusubilo Chakaniza, the managing director of Ethanol Company, saying that the project entails the construction of a unit specialized in valorising ethanol waste into agricultural fertilizer and power.

The Press Corporation conglomerate’s division that specializes in the manufacturing of drinkable alcohol, creates approximately 12 litres of vinasse for every litre of ethanol produced. This equates to 218 million litres of effluent exiting EthCo’s facilities each year. The EthCo effluent will be upgraded at the EthCo Plant by bio-digestion, evaporation, treatment, and drying of the condensate to create biogas. According to Lusubilo Chakaniza the biogas would be utilized to generate steam to drive a turbine and generate around 2 MW of energy, making the facility self-sufficient in electricity. The vinasse will also be used to make a potassium-rich granular organic fertilizer, which will be packaged in 50-kilogram sacks and sold at a low cost. Water collected from the processing system will also be treated and recycled in the facility. Currently, the vinasse is being dried in evaporation ponds, and the dried sludge is being used by farmers in the Dwangwa area for crop nutrition and soil conditioning. The EthCo Plant is scheduled to open in December 2022. EthCo will pay 5.2 billion Malawi kwacha, or around $6.4 million, for the implementation of the whole project.
