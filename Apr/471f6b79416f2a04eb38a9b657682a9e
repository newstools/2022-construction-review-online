The Ontario government has granted a contract for the substantial expansion of Go Transit service in the Toronto area. The project includes more than 120 miles of additional track as well as the electrification of over 370 miles of the system. The electrification will also bring new trains capable of surpassing 85 mph, as well as two-way, all-day service on some routes and service with headways of 15 minutes or fewer. Metrolinx and ONxpress Transportation Partners, the multibillion-dollar contract winner, will now undertake a 24-month development phase for design, timetable, and initial construction. “Transforming the GO rail network and delivering two-way, all-day service will be a game changer for the residents of the Greater Golden Horseshoe,” said Stan Cho, Ontario’s associate minister of transportation, in a provincial government press release. “Commuters will gain from easier access to home, work, as well as recreation if there are faster and more convenient methods to go from point A to point B throughout the region.” Read also: Plans for Alberta High Speed Rail revived, Canada Construction is planned to begin in 2023, with the first enhancements to service arriving in 2025 or 2026. According to Metrolinx, the two-way, all-day service is planned on the Lakeshore East and West lines, the Kitchener Line, the Barrie Line, and the Stouffville Line, and is intended to upgrade the system from one focused on those travelling to downtown Toronto into “a regional backbone that connects high-growth communities across the region.” Early construction and off-corridor projects totaling more than C$11 billion are already underway, including the renovation of 16 stations, upgrades to 29 other stations, and expansion projects on six corridors.  The GO project, coupled with continuing subway and light rail projects in the Toronto area, totals C$61 billion in investment.
