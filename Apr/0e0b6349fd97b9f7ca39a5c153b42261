Kansas City officials have revealed plans for a $160 million South Loop Link project, which will create a deck over a four-block-long section, along Interstate 670 from Wyandotte Street to Grand Boulevard. The project is intended to redevelop the sunken freeway built in the 1960s, which now creates a divide between the midtown and downtown areas. The proposed deck for the South Loop Link project will have the design of a park, consisting of several playgrounds and paths, straddling the I-670 freeway between vehicle bridges. This will provide a new outdoor amenity for the downtown region, with added green infrastructure and trees, to help minimize the environmental impacts of the highway below. Other planned developments for the project include a green mobility hub, healthy living space, dog parks, arts and amphitheatre programming, and other provisions for social engagement opportunities.
