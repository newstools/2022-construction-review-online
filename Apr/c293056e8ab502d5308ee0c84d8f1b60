The refurbishment of the Katara Hospitality owned Somerset West Bay Doha, which opened back in 2008 with a total number of 200 units that comprised two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments aimed and focused mainly to cater to the needs of long-stay guests, has been completed. This was confirmed by Ascott Limited, a Singaporean wholly owned lodging business of CapitaLand Investment and one of Asia’s largest diversified real estate groups. The newly refurbished and renovated Somerset West Bay Doha hotel now offers 228 units in one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom apartments and is focused on all types of travelers ranging from leisure, solo, and/or business travelers. Located parallel to Diplomatic Street, Somerset West is ideally positioned particularly for business travelers with reasonable and easy access to embassies, ministry quarters, consulates, and the Doha Exhibition and Convention Centre.
