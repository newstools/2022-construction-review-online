The World’s Largest 3D-Printed Concrete Building has been completed in Oman. The project’s team comprised of Mexican Cement Company Cemex, the German University of Technology (GUtech) in Oman, and Danish 3D printer maker, Cobod. The 2,100 square foot structured building was produced using real concrete and has been designed as a typical Oman house. It features a reception area, a living room, a kitchen, and three bedrooms. The concrete that was used for the walls of the World’s Largest 3D-Printed Concrete Building cost about €1,600. Cubod said that the printable dry mix mortar that is commonly used in printed buildings would have cost from €20,000 and more. The construction works of the World’s Largest 3D-Printed Concrete Building took place over two stages. The first stage was dedicated to fine-tuning the concrete recipe as well as training the Omani crew. The subsequent stage was all about construction works which are said to have taken 5 days. Instead of using the traditional dry mixed mortar that is often used in other 3D printed structures, GUtech took on a different approach. The institution employed a D fab solution that was developed by Cemex and Cobod that consisted of locally sourced sand, gravel, and cement. The mix made, according to the team, was much easier to deposit and in addition, significantly reduce construction costs.

For the project, well over 99.5% of the construction materials used were all sourced locally; it is said that 0.5% of the construction materials came from Europe.
