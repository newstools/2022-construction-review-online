The administration building will also be rehabilitated and the outer facade of the maternity and theatre blocks restored. The ICT infrastructure and equipment will also be developed as part of the project so as to allow modern operations of the facility. According to Mr Tambil, the project’s contractor is Amandi Investment Ltd, a leading civil & marine EPC contractor that designs, builds and manages large scale infrastructure projects. The ENRH Medical Director explained that certain staff and patients occupying specifically designated facilities, such as the accident and emergency centre, antenatal and postnatal clinic, laboratories, orthopaedics, CT scan centre, children’s ward A and C, would be moved into temporary structures soon to pave the way for the construction of new facilities. The hospital tower block, however as well as the teacher’s building, administration, kitchen, and laundry, will be exempted. Amandi would temporarily substitute some of the collapsed structures with containers to ensure that public services are not affected.
