The long-awaited redevelopment of the 94-year-old United Artists Building in downtown Detroit has finally begun. The plans were revealed at a groundbreaking ceremony by Bagley Development Group LLC and Olympia Development. In a US$ 75M makeover, the historic United Artists Building, which previously operated as a theatre in the city’s downtown, will soon be home to approximately 150 mixed-income apartments. The project, along with five other developments in the District of Detroit, was first announced in 2017. Only the Eddystone has been finished so far. The 18-story structure will be rebuilt into 148 one- and two-bedroom flats, with 20% classified as affordable at 80% AMI.

C. Howard Crane designed the United Artists building, which opened in 1928. In the 1920s, it housed one of the several theatres that surrounded Grand Circus Park. The theatre was the showpiece of the structure, which housed several offices. It closed in 1975, after decades of deterioration. It is a National Register of Historic Places listing. While some believed the theatre may be saved, it will be demolished. Brinker/Christman is the construction manager on the project, while Hobbs + Black is the architect. “We are honored to construct Residences@150 Bagley in such a thriving community on behalf of Bagley Development Group partners Scott Allen, Larry Brinker, Sr., Tom Goss, Richard Hosey, Roy Roberts, Jim Thrower, and myself.” “Residences@150 Bagley is the ideal paradigm for urban development, with the public and private sectors collaborating to serve the neighborhood,” stated managing partner Emmett Moten.
