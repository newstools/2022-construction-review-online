Recently, A Heart Relief Organization (AHRO) broke ground for the construction of the Leukemia Research and Treatment Institute in Ghana, Greater Accra’s Shai Osudoku District. Speaking at the sod-cutting ceremony, the organization’s president, Dr. Prince John Tetteh, stated that while their establishment is not in the habit of announcing its efforts to the needy, which has been the organization’s mode of operation since its inception twenty-two years ago, this endeavor is indeed a milestone and the first of its kind. The project will include the construction of the main administration building, a library, an ICT center, research, and development department, laboratories, pharmacy, canteen, main auditorium, conference center, employee residences, flats for patients’ relatives, and a mini-assemble plant where PPEs and other basic medical equipment will be produced and assembled under license, creating job opportunities.

While acknowledging the continent’s broad health concerns, Dr. Prince John Tetteh said that lasting remedies to ailments can only come from Africans themselves, and this can be accomplished by employing a variety of creative and inventive financing methods to fund programs such as the construction of the Leukemia Research and Treatment Institute in Ghana. While the facility is primarily focused on leukemia, it will also address other cancers. According to Dr. Prince John Tetteh, the AHRO’s main objective is to cure every cancer patient who is seeking treatment, and the Leukaemia Research and Treatment Institute in Ghana will help the West African region and its neighbors.
