These projects, initiated by the Saudi Arabian government are to make Riyadh not just a more livable city but an internationally attractive city as well. The project was conceived as some sort of “green heart” for the city of Riyadh. As it is located near the geographic center of the growing metropolitan city, the park will be served by 10 bus rapid transit stations and five brand new metro stations. The park will include an internal “urban loop”, a circular promenade that will cater to cycling, walking, and other autonomous and sustainable modes of public transportation. Moreover, the King Salman Park project will offer its visitors a climate-responsive personal thermal comfort and urban design strategy that will ensure the activities of cycling and walking are pleasant throughout the whole year. The park’s landscape form will also include a series of branching valleys that have been inspired by Saudi Arabia’s seasonally dry water (wadi) river beds that converge towards the center of the park.
