Now that demolition permits for 140 N. Ashland Avenue have been awarded, a new mixed-use project under Marquette Companies is poised to begin building shortly in Chicago. The current structure, located at the junction of N Ashland Avenue and W Lake Street, was previously home to the Women’s Treatment Center, which elected to sell the site because they wanted to decrease their business. Brininstool + Lynch designed the new development, which will include a 12-story residential structure that will link to an existing 1920s building at the site’s southern end. The 210-unit property will stand 154 feet tall, with ground-floor retail and amenity space. The residential unit mix will consist of studios, one-, two-, and three-bedroom homes. Its entrance will protrude out into the sidewalk to define the entryway, whilst the retail entrance will be inserted at the building’s corner. The coworking amenity area will be positioned along N Ashland Avenue for tenant use, with 62 parking spaces on the main level and the basement behind it. The 12th story will have more tenant amenity space, as well as a roof deck. The plan will fulfill sustainability standards by achieving Energy Star certification, surpassing the energy code by 10%, utilizing green roofs, being close to transportation, adding EV charging stations, offering a CTA digital display, and diverting 80 percent of construction trash. The development will fulfill affordability standards by including 15% affordable homes. The first 10% of apartments will be on-site, with the remaining 5% either onsite or offsite. The 15% will amount to 32 units. The site’s zoning has been changed from RM-5 (Residential Multi-Unit District) to B3-5 (Community Shopping District). The $52 million projects was authorized by the City Council in May 2021. There has been no formal announcement of a construction timeline.
