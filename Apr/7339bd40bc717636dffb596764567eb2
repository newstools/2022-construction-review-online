Recently, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi ordered the construction of the Al-Hadara axis as a new entry to the El-Mokattam hills, and to connect the suburb with the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation (NMEC) in Cairo. The president made the directive in a recent meeting with a group of engineering authorities to evaluate the progress of a number of Armed Forces Engineering Authority projects across the country, particularly the Greater Cairo axes. According to the Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady, the Al-Hadara axis would run through Cairo’s Ain Al-Sira neighbourhood and connect to the Nile Corniche area in El-Maadi. A number of new transverse axes stretching to East and New Cairo will intersect with the axis.

The spokesman said that this will make it easier to connect the hills to Cairo’s various districts and allow people to move about freely. President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi further addressed attempts to increase the efficiency of South Sinai highways, particularly those connecting Nuweiba and Taba, as well as the process of improving Upper Egypt’s roads. He directed that construction on these new and key axes extending over the Nile River be continued in order to facilitate citizen transportation and serve development projects and new urban communities. Efforts to improve the region around Youssef Abbas Street in Nasr City were also addressed during the meeting, as well as the Al-Shams Club and neighbouring lands, where a monorail station is under construction. The head of state was also informed of attempts to use vacant land along the sides of axes and roads for the building of alternative housing units, as well as the International Motor City’s executive position.
