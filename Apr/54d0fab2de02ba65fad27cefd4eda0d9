American Dream Mall is a proposed US$4 billion retail and entertainment complex that is set for construction in the Everglades region of Florida, near Everglades National Park and within Miami-Dade County’s Urban Development Boundary. Developed by Triple Five Group, which is also responsible for the development of the Mall of America in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the American Dream Mall project will build about double the size of the country’s current biggest mall, the King of Prussia Mall in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to become the new largest mall in the United States. It will resemble an amusement park rather than a standard, dumbbell-shaped mall and include a water park with a massive indoor pool, an indoor ice rink, a ski slope, “submarine” rides, dozens of restaurants, and up to 1,200 businesses. The project does not yet have a specified timetable. The facility is expected to attract 30 million visitors every year, according to Triple Five. According to the developers, that’s around 10 million fewer visitors than the Mall of America, which produces about US$2 billion in revenue for Minnesota each year. There has been some criticism of the new initiative. A number of current malls in Miami say that the city doesn’t need another mall because it already has a crowded retail sector.

Miami’s new complex might serve as a more feasible model for failing malls and future malls. Unlike standard suburban malls, the American Dream Miami concentrates on interactive entertainment, with the water park and ice rink located in the atrium. The project falls under the category of “destination malls,” which are often located in metropolitan centers and attract tourists from all around the region rather than just those who reside locally.
