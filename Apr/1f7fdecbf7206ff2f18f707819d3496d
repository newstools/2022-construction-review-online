The Majid Al Futtaim Communities have launched the final neighborhood that is located within the Al Zahia Development in Sharjah. The Majid Al Futtaim Communities is a firm that is a part of the Majid Al Futtaim Properties and Sharjah Holding. The project is mostly targeted toward young couples that are looking to build their first home together. The final neighborhood in the Al Zahia Development is also targeted at larger families that are looking for a villa that can cater to a spectrum of different lifestyle needs. The Al Zahia Development project within the neighborhood will feature 80 individual freehold plots that will be available. This would represent to investors and owner-occupiers a superb and exceptional opportunity to create their ideal home property in the city of Sharjah’s premier gated community. The community itself is said to offer an array of ample opportunities for residents to lead a lifestyle that is outdoor active. The neighborhood features a landscaped park at its heart that is lush and offers a space for residents to gather and share a connection with nature. The CEO of Majid Al Futtaim Communities, Hawazen Esber, expressed that the new neighborhood had been specifically built a short distance walk away from the Al Zahia amenities. These amenities include but are not limited to the clubhouse that has got its very own two resort-type of styled swimming pools, a signature restaurant, and a gymnasium.
