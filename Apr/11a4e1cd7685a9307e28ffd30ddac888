The State Council of China has approved the construction of two additional reactors at each of China’s nuclear power plant locations of Sanmen, Haiyang, and Lufeng, after years of preparation, extensive evaluation, and review. The approvals are for Sanmen units 3 and 4, Haiyang units 3 and 4, and Lufeng units 5 and 6. Both the Sanmen and Haiyang plants already have two AP1000 units, and two CAP1000 units. Following the approval in question, the Chinese version of the AP1000 will be built in Phase II (units 3 and 4) of the two plants. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has also approved the proposed construction of four CAP1000 reactors (units 1-4) at the new Lufeng site, but the State Council is yet to approve the same. However, together with Phase II (units 3 and 4) of Sanmen, Haiyang power plants, the State Council approved the construction of Lufeng plant units 5 and 6, which China General Nuclear announced in a Shenzhen Stock Exchange statement on April 21 would be Hualong One reactors. The NDRC announced its 14th Five-Year Plan for the Modern Energy System last month, with the objective of increasing the country’s share of non-fossil energy consumption to around 20% by 2025 and the amount of non-fossil power generation to around 39% by then.
