Shovels will soon be on the earth as Michigan State University prepares to break ground on its new Skandalaris Football Center following the approval of the start of the first phase of the project that is expected to cost $11 million by the school’s Board of Trustees. This phase entails the relocation of the present weight room, demolishing the existing structure, and erecting temporary walls and utilities to prepare the site for the full makeover. While the first phase is expected to be completed in October 2023, in June this year the sports department will propose a budget for the entire project. When completed, the Michigan State University’s New Football Center will include a new entrance on its south side, along Chestnut Road, as well as new player lockers, meeting spaces, rehabilitation quarters, food, nutrition, and health and wellness sections. The weight room will be increased, as well as the football team auditorium, which will be restored.

Greg Williams and his wife, who co-founded a Grand Rapids insurance agency, on the other hand, contributed a $10 million contribution later in 2021. The board also authorized two Spartan Stadium renovations for this year: $2.5 million in maintenance and structural repairs to the lower bowl, and a new $1.6 million sound system to be installed this spring and summer in preparation for the fall 2022 season. “(Ishbia’s) gift will have a profound impact on our program and is a statement that Michigan State is relentless about excellence, both on and off the field, and our pursuit of championships,” Tucker said during a virtual press conference.
