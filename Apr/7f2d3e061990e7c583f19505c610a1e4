A joint venture of CPB Contractors and United Infrastructure that is comprised of three Western Sydney businesses i.e. Mulgoa Quarries, Burton Contractors, and JK Williams, was awarded a $538.5 million surface and civil alignment works contract for the Western Sydney Airport line project that was previously known as Sydney Metro Greater West. The contract particularly covers the construction of a 3.5-kilometer elevated viaduct between Orchard Hills and Luddenham, 7 kilometers of earthwork for railroad building, a 190-meter-long rail bridge across the new M12 freeway, a 20-meter-long rail bridge within the airport, construction of temporary and permanent access roads, and large-scale earthworks for the stabling and maintenance facilities site.

The $538.5 million surface and civil alignment work contract for the Sydney Metro – Western Sydney Airport project is a huge boost to Western Sydney where more than 20% of the labor force for this project is expected to be sourced from. As work on this contract ramps up in the coming months, United Infrastructure will generate 50 new positions, including apprentices and trainees, to assist in constructing the new metro rail line. 4 The Sydney Metro – Western Sydney Airport Project will also source a minimum of 50% Australian steel, including reinforcing on all three of the project’s core contract packages, further increasing work opportunities in Australia. 5 Australia and New South Wales governments are collaborating to fund the Sydney Metro – Western Sydney Airport project. The project’s third and last major contract package is expected to be granted by the end of this year. 6
