They will also have access to facilities such as a swimming pool, a fitness center, a business center, and a children’s activity area, to mention a few. According to Max Whipple, Vice President of Development at the NRP Group (NRP), 330 of the San Marcos multi-family apartment complex units will be set aside for families and people earning up to 60% of the regional median income, with one, two, three, and four-bedroom units available to rent. “The cost of house ownership and market-rate apartments in San Marcos is rising as the city grows. This construction is critical in order to provide housing alternatives to a critical section of the local workers, ensuring that they are not priced out of the market,” explained Whipple. The location of the project, which is expected to be completed in December 2024, is according to Whipple ideal for sustaining and generating further economic activity in San Marcos since it is close to Tanger Outlets and job centers along the I-35 corridor.
