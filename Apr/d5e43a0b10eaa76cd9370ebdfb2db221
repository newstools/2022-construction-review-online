BESIX, a Belgian contractor, through its subsidiary BESIX Ivory Coast, has been chosen by the Ministry of Public Works and Road Maintenance to design and construct the Abobo tunnel. Speaking on the appointment the general manager of Business Development, Philippe Dessoy, stated that the Abobo tunnel in Abidjan demonstrates their strong presence in the Ivory Coast, and the excellence of their collaboration with PFO Africa adding that the Abobo location allowed them to bring infrastructure, another of BESIX’s primary areas of competence, to the Ivory Coast. Philippe Dessoy said that they were very delighted to be a part of the implementation of a world-class project for the benefit of Abidjan and the country, under the umbrella of PFO Africa. A cut-and-cover approach will be used to construct the Abobo tunnel in Abidjan, which will be 210 meters long, with a 560-meter road segment and two access ramps. The project calls for 130,000m3 of trench excavation, 4,000 tonnes of reinforcement, and 23,000m3 of structural concrete pouring.

Featuring a total of three lanes in each direction, the Abobo tunnel, upon completion is expected to ease traffic flow in the Abobo district of Abidjan which has a population of over one million people. The Abodo Town Hall roundabout where the tunnel culminates connects numerous key roads, including those that link the country’s economic hub to the east and northeast.
